My hectare was mostly inaccessible, being comprised of a lot of the zoo which was ""authorized access only"" or not yet open.

I live in Stuyvesant Town, an area of Manhattan with an incredibly dense squirrel population. The squirrels in Stuy Townn are bold and fearless -- they want a nut and they want it now. They've become accustomed to being fed nuts by Stuy Town residents, primarily the elderly residents. Drop a nut, especially a premium one, such as a full walnut in its shell, and they will arrive en mass. The squirrels I saw today in Central Park, while they did not approach me, would not have needed much coaxing. You can ""turn"" a squirrel pretty quickly in this town.
