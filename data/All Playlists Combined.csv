[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing ""Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing ""Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" We'll say ""No man""
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Over the ground lies the mantle of light
A heaven of diamond in the lovely night
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then give him a name and call him Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" And then we'll say ""No man""
But now you can do the job whenever you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream sittin' by the fire
To face unafraid all the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking walking in a winter wonderland

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo-hoo
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up it's grand
Just holding your hand

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like birds of a feather would be

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a Christmas party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop pop pop

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
As they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fires gloosy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says let it snow let it snow let it snow

Let it snow!

Oooooh wee goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says let it snow let it snow let it snow

I don't care!

The weather outside is frightful
But that fire is mmm-delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are way down low
So let it snow let it snow let it snow!

Let it snow!

When we finally say goodnight
How I'll hate going out in a storm
But if you'll only hold me yight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

You're a monster Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole

You're a vile one Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile Mr. Grinch
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile

[Verse 4]
You're a foul one Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk Mr. Grinch
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows and I quote:
""Stink. Stank. Stunk.""

[Verse 5]
You're a rotter Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment
Of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled-up knots

[Verse 6]
You nauseate me Mr. Grinch
With a nauseous super-naus
You're a crooked jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked hoss Mr. Grinch
You're a three-decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce

Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

(oh gee)
It's about a man you've heard of and I knew him well

He was born on a cold winter's morning
And went on to gain great fame
But may I begin my story
And refer to him by name?
(Please do)

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul (ooooh)
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman made the children smile they say
And were they surprised when he rolled his eyes
And he came to life that day!

There must of been some magic
In that ol' silk cap they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal!
Were they surprised when he rolled his eyes and he came to life that day!

(But Uncle Jimmy you didn't finish your story.)
I know I just paused to catch my breath
(What happened to frosty when he came to life that day?)
Well he got in a lot of trouble you see?

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun before I melt away
(Where'd he go?)
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there and around the square
Sayin' ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler ""Stop!""

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry
I'll be back again someday!

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at that Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""You Hoo""
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go
Let's look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

In fields where they lay keeping their sheep

Hark the herald angels sing ""glory to the newborn king
Peace on earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim christ is born in bethlehem""

What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste haste to bring him laud
The babe the son of Mary

Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian fear: for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
Nails spear shall pierce Him through
The Cross be borne for me for you;
Hail hail the Word made flesh
The Babe the Son of Mary

So bring him incense gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him
Raise raise the song on high
The Virgin sing her lullaby:
Joy joy for Christ is born
The Babe the Son of Mary

(Chorus)
Oh the rising of the sun and the running of the deer
The playing of the merry organ sweet singing in the choir

The holly bears a blossom as white as lily flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to be our sweet savior

(Chorus)
The holly bears a berry as red as any blood
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to do poor sinners good

(Chorus)
The holly bears a prickle as sharp as any thorn
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ on Christmas Day in the morn

(Chorus)
The holly bears a bark as bitter as any gall
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ for to redeem us all

This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby it's bad out there)
Say what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat your hair looks swell)
I ought to say ""No no no sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But baby you'd freeze out there)
Say lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
""They've got cars big as bars they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
""I could have been someone""
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

What child is this who laid to rest

Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping
This this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing

The babe the son of Mary
Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding
Good Christian fear for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
So bring Him incense gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
This this is Christ the King

The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing
But I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember a worst December
Just you watch those icicles fall
What do I care if those icicles fall
I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat off with my glove
Who needs an overcoat I'm burning with love

My heart's on fire and the fire gets higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I really can't stay/(Baby I'm fine with that)

I've got to go away (Baby I'm cool with that)

This evening has been (Been hoping you get home safe)

So very nice (I'm glad you had a real good time)

My mother will start to worry (Call her so she knows that you're coming)

Father will be pacing the floor (Better get your car a-humming)

So really I'd better scurry (No rush)

Should I use the front or back door? (Which one are you pulling towards more?)

The neighbors might think (That you're a real nice girl)

What is this drink? (Pomegranate La Croix)

I wish I knew how (Maybe I can help you out)

To break this spell (I don't know what you're talking about)

I ought to say no no no (you reserve the right to say no)

At least I'm gonna say that I tried (you reserve the right to say no)

I really can't stay (...Well you don't have to)

Baby it's cold outside

I've got to get home (Do you know how to get there from here)

Say where is my coat (I'll go and grab it my dear)

You've really been grand (We'll have to do this again)

Yes I agree (How 'bout the Cheesecake Factory?)

We're bound to be talking tomorrow (Text me at your earliest convenience)

At least I have been getting that vibe (Unless I catch pneumonia and die)

I'll be on my way (Thanks for the great night)

The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees O hear the angels voices
O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night O night divine

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friend

He knows our need to our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever
His power and glory evermore proclaim
O night divine O night O night divine

Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies

Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace
Hail the Sun of Righteousness

Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth

[Refrain]
Hark the herald angels sing
“Glory to the newborn King
Glory to the newborn King”

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Seen it with my own eyes
You gotta be careful when you've got good love
'Cause then angels will just keep on multiplying

Maybe this Christmas will mean something more
Maybe this year love will appear
Deeper than ever before

And maybe forgiveness will ask us to call
Someone we love someone we've lost
For reasons we can’t quite recall
Maybe this Christmas

Maybe there’ll be an open door
Maybe the star that shone before
Will shine once more oh

And maybe this Christmas will find us at last
In heavenly peace grateful at least
For the love we've been shown in the past oh
Maybe this Christmas maybe this Christmas

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart

I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry - Beautiful what's your hurry?
Father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful please don't hurry
Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think - Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell - I'll take your hat your hair looks swell

I ought to say no no no sir - Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Ah but it's cold outside

I simply must go - But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no - But baby it's cold outside
This welcome has been - How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm - Look out that window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious - God your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon the tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Ooh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more - Never such a blizzard before

I got to get home - But baby you'd freeze out there
Say lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - I thrill when you touch my hand
Why don't you see - How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that hold out
Ah but it's cold outside
Oh baby it's cold outside
Oh baby it's cold outside

Gather near to us once more

If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Chorus]
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudy
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudy the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

[Bridge]

Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy yap giddy yap giddy yap let's go let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap giddy yap giddy yap it's grand just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
That he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Thumpetty thump thump thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump over the hills of snow
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said ""Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin' ""Catch me if you can""
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
He only paused a moment
When he heard him holler ""Stop""
Because ol' Frosty the snowman he had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day I'll be back again some day
I'll be back again some day""

O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

The thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees oh hear the angel voices

O night divine

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices

[Verse 1]
Stockings are hung with care
As children sleep with one eye open
Well now there's more than toys at stake
Cause I'm older now but not done hoping

[Verse 2]
The twinkling of the lights
The scent of candles fill the household
'Ol Saint Nick has taken flight
With a heart on board so please be careful

[Pre-Chorus]
Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Verse 3]
A tree that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but this evening can be a holy night
So cozy on up by the fireplace
And dim those Christmas lights

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

They call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving

[Chorus]
Just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater
Walk proudly to the mistletoe tonight
I want something to last forever
So kiss me on this cold December Night

[Closing]
Call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours for the taking
Call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

[Verse 1]
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
No I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
There's no sense in hanging stockings
There upon the fireplace
Cause Santa he won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day


[Hook]
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
Girl what can I do?
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

[Verse 2]
And all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really love
Won't you please bring my baby to me...

[Chorus]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
No I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own
More that you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day
Strings of streetlights even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear
Silver bells silver bells

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the north pole to spend a holiday

I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me so

You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Then kids in Girl and Boyland will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Now Santa is a busy man He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh so

You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watched their flock by night
And see a bright new shining star
And hear a choir sing
The music seem to come from afar

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
And find no place to borne she child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

[Hook 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Outro]
So it's Christmas once more

Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me

I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart

Someday soon we all will be together if the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""Let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day

There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Outro]
Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord and full of admiration (So praise the lord)

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Hello Dan it's Joe here
I hope you're keeping well
It's the 21st of December
And now they're ringing the last bells
If I get good behaviour
I'll be out of here by July
Won't you kiss my kids on Christmas Day?
Please don't let 'em cry for me

I guess the brothers are driving down from Queensland
And Stella's flying in from the coast
They say it's gonna be a hundred degrees even more maybe
But that won't stop the roast
Who's gonna make the gravy now?
I bet it won't taste the same
Just add flour salt a little red wine
And don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce
For sweetness and that extra tang

And give my love to Angus and to Frank and Dolly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry I screwed up this time
And look after Rita I'll be thinking of her

I hear Mary's got a new boyfriend
I hope he can hold his own
Do you remember the last one? What was his name again?
Ahh just a little too much cologne
And Roger you know I'm even gonna miss Roger
'Cause there's sure as hell no one in here I want to fight

[Chorus 2]
Oh praise the Baby Jesus have a Merry Christmas
I'm really gonna miss it all the treasure and the trash
And later in the evening I can just imagine
You'll put on Junior Murvin and push the tables back

[Chorus 3]
And you'll dance with Rita I know you really like her
Just don't hold her too close
Oh brother please don't stab me in the back
I didn't mean to say that it's just my mind it plays up
Multiplies each matter turns imagination into fact

[Chorus 4]
You know I love her badly she's the one to save me
I'm gonna make some gravy I'm gonna taste the fat
Ahh tell her that I'm sorry yeah I love her badly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry and kiss the sleepy children for me
You know one of these days I'll be making gravy
I'll be making plenty I'm gonna pay 'em all back

[Outro]
Yeah do-do-do-do do-do
Do-do-do-do do-do

[Verse]
Ome they told me
Our newborn King to see
Our finest gifts we bring
To lay before the King

This is to honor Him
When we come
Baby Jesus I am a poor boy too
I have no gift to bring
That's fit to give a King

But may I play for You
On my drum?
The Mother Mary nodded
The ox and lamb kept time
I played my drum for Him
I played my best for Him

[Outro]
Then He smiled at me
Me and my drum

[Verse 1]
Christmas night another fight
Tears we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

[Refrain]
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Verse 2]
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

[Refrain]
Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Chorus]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

[Chorus]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Oh Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone

Watching the people around

The church bells in town
They're ringing a song
What a happy sound
Baby please come home

They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

Pretty lights on the tree
I'm watching 'em shine
You should be here with me
Baby please come home

Baby please come home
Baby please come home

They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

If there was a way
I'd hold back these tears

What time is it baby is it that time again?
When snow will be falling friends will be calling
You know it's time when there'll be carolers singing silent night
I love when they sing the feeling it brings
It's warm as a fire is bright
Soon there'll be toys for good girls and boys
And reindeer are heading our way
Yes and Santa will come down the chimney above
There's one thing I wanted to say

[Chorus]
I wish every day could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish every day could be full of peace and harmony
I wish every day could be like Christmas I do

[Verse 2]
I saw a child sit with old Mr. Clause
Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earth was
Now the old man grew cautious on how he would say
That it's the greatest gift what you could give every day

Now the mistle-toes and the house of Lords
All the world seems at ease tonight
And all that I ask when these precious moments pass
Is why can't every day be so bright

I think I saw ol' Santa through my window Christmas eve
My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe
It must've been ol' Santa 'cause I saw his big red hat
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that Oh no
I know my Mom and Dad can't fly like that

And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door
The same ol' Christmas trick my dad had played since I was four
He stands outside my bedroom yelling 'Ho! Ho! Ho!' because
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus no way
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus

I think my daddy sees me
Peeking from my door
But he pretends he's Santa anyway
Every year he tries to fool me
But I'm a big boy now I don't believe in Santa or his sleigh...
No way!

So I went back to my bed and I curled up nice and tight
I stared out of my window and I looked into the night
And then all of a sudden through my window I could see
Santa Claus was flying by and smiling at me

Chorus:
Santa Claus Santa Claus
It must've been ol' Santa Claus
Santa Claus Santa Claus
Happy 'Ho! Ho! Ho!' to you

Then I heard ol' Rudolph tellin' me to come outside
He told me that ol' Santa wanted me to take a ride
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh
And then ol' Santa took me up and away
Santa took me up up and away

We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said
'Little boys like you should be in bed'

So I hollered 'Ho! Ho! Ho!'
And I put on Santa's hat
Then he let me hold the reins a while
We pulled up to my window
And I jumped back in my room
And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile

When I woke up Christmas morning (well) it was clear and bright
My parents said my window had blown open in the night
I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat
And they asked me where I got my big red hat Yeah yeah
They asked me where I got my big red hat

Chorus

Happy Ho! Ho! Ho! to you! (18x)

In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one

This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas

When all our dreams come true

You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

Childhood dreaming is a thing of the past

Today's celebration is bittersweet

There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

[Verse 2]
Oh I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby all I want for Christmas is you
You baby

[Bridge]
Oh all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah oh oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
You baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you baby (Ah oh ah oh)

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh I wanna have him beside me like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th by that fireplace oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh baby
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
If he will be if he will be here
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
Oh woah

[Chorus]
Santa tell me (Santa tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be if he won't be here)
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk

And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well

And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Man it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Oh mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
But baby don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no no no
Aw baby it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see no no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
He's checking it twice;
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Cause Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

T's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the Five and Ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots

Dolls that will talk and go for a walk

Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!

I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus (kissing kissing Santa Claus)
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep

Then I saw mommy tickle tickle (tickle tickle Santa Claus)
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
And I'm gonna tell my dad

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

I love those JINGLE bells
Those holiday JINGLE bells
All those happy JINGLE BE double LLES
I love those JINGLE bells

Jingle all the way

(Some other version:)
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Echo: Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh O
Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead

Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know

How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say

He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day

So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Christmas night another fight
Tears we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Verse 2]
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Light up the fireworks in me

And I wanna tell the world
Before I get too old
And don't remember it
So let's december it
And reassemble it (oh yeah)

Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To feel the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

Verse:
At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness?

With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Get my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style

Pre-Chorus:
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can know some happiness with me

Chorus:
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness

Come on you all

Bridge:
I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow and
They believe again

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all

At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple try to stop
Come on Melly-pops

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
Pumpkin pie anyone?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
This is so corny
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Wow I am in the most almighty Christmas groove

If my friends could see me now
How do I look?
Ridiculous

Yeah me too Kim but let's wait till the record's over
Kim do you think our love will last forever?

Couple of years maybe?

Do you think we'll make it to the end of the record?
How long is that - exactly?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
All together now
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Excuse me can I sing something now?
Get lost Griff!
Well that's nice...

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Root beer anyone?

Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow

We’re going to be a classic for all time
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

[Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Bridge: Gwen & Blake]
I never thought I’d find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Oooh (thank you baby)

[Outro: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 1]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home

Two more reasons why I love you so

Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days untill you coming home

If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep

[VERSE]
I'll hang stockings by the fire
Take peppermint canes out the cupboard
Up to the attic a box full of lights
So much more we’ve left to discover

[PRE-Chorus]
Ribbons all entangled in the garland
Mistletoe and angel's wings
Might be here for a little bit but darling
If it's with you it’s okay with me

[Chorus]
Oh do you know what's got me feeling fine?
It's the two of us
And Christmastime
There ain't nothing else
That brings us to life
Quite like ringing bells
And Christmastime

[VERSE 2]
Outside's a caroling choir
The snow is lined around the window
It's cold and baby we're tired
Wrap ourselves up head to toe

[PRE-Chorus]
Listen for the reindeer on the rooftop
He knows who's been good this year
All the elves are on vacation from the workshop
It’s almost here

Oh do you know what’s got me feeling fine?
It's the two of us
And Christmastime
There ain’t nothing else
That brings us to life

Only Christmastime is like this
Everybody's filled with cheer
I wish we could stop our watches
And keep all the magic here

There ain’t nothing else

[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
""They've got cars big as bars they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
""I could have been someone""
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out

[Intro]
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""Let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day

[Bridge]
Oh a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Outro]
Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us (This day will live forever)

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh I wanna have him beside me like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th by that fireplace oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh baby
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
If he will be if he will be here
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
Oh woah

[Chorus]
Santa tell me (Santa tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Santa tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be if he won't be here)

Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes. he comes
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes. he comes
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for everyone's Christmas joys
Tito had just one desire
That he gets a new guitar
But he wants a guarantee
That it won't play out of key
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Up on the housetop click click click
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
O
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me
Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep
Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
We wish you a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmaswe wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy new year

My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 1]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Bridge]
Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days untill you coming home
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 1]
Tonight I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday
Alone to celebrate

[Pre-Chorus]
But then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing

Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 2]
I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing

Alone on Christmas day
Presents what a beautiful sight

Oh Santa I've been waiting on you

Oh Santa I've been killing just for fun
Well the party's over kid because I
Because I got a bullet in my gun
A bullet in your what?

Santa's got a bullet in his gun
You know it Santa's got a bullet in his gun

But the children on the block they tease me

[Verse 2: Brandon Flowers & Santa]
Oh Santa It's been a real hard year (Year)
There just ain't no getting around this life is hard
But look at me I turned out alright
Hey Santa why don't we talk about it? Work it out
Believe me this ain't what I wanted
I love all you kids you know that
Hell I remember when you were just 10 years old
Playing out there in the desert
Just waiting for a sip of that sweet Mojave rain

[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
In the sweet Mojave rain the boy was on his own

[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Don't shoot me Santa Claus
I've been a clean living boy I promise you

Hey Santa Claus
Well no one else around believes me
But the children on the block they tease me
I couldn't let them off that easy

[Bridge: Brandon Flowers]
They had it coming so why can't you see?
I couldn't turn my cheek no longer
The sun is going down and Christmas is near
Just look the other way and I'll disappear forever
Woo!

Don't shoot me Santa Claus
Well no one else around believes me!
But the children on the street they tease me
I couldn't let them off that easy

""Bah humbug!"" No that's too strong
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy

To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from

Last year ski shop
Encounter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines

So deck those halls trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!

Flashback to springtime saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried we said we'd keep in touch

Didn't of course 'til summertime
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree

Now the calendar's just one page
And of course I am excited
Tonight's the night but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Hardly dashing through the snow
Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-do's
A few cards a few calls
'Cause it's r-s-v-p
No thanks no party lights
It's Christmas Eve gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites

Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go

Forget it it's cold it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?

So on with the boots back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!

""I'm spending this one alone"" he said
""Need a break; this year's been crazy.""
I said ""Me too but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?""

Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending! ""

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!

Are you hanging up your stocking on the wall?
Is it time that every Santa has a ball?
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer?
Does he tug upon a sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best?
And she's up and rock n rolling with the rest
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now it's only just begun
What will your daddy do
When he sees your mamma kissing Santa Claus?
Ahhh ahhh
Ahhh ahhh
Are you hinging up your socking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you rattle down the hillside
In the buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head then you will say
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
It's only just begun

Not in the ghetto
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)

As soon as you're asleep a chimney will appear
And in the morning you will see all he brings
Don't you worry that their ain't no chimney's in the projects""

Not in the ghetto

Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears

Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say a prayer
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Chorus]
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane

[Verse 2]
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed and cover up your head
Because Santa Claus comes tonight

[Chorus]
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane

[Verse 3]
He doesn't care if you're a rich or poor boy
He loves you just the same
Santa knows that we're God's children
That makes everything right
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Chorus]
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane

[Outro]
He'll come around when the chimes ring out
It's Christmas morn again
Peace on Earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
Let's give thanks to the Lord above
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Intro (spoken)]
Jimmy I just came back from a lovely trip along the milky way
I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday
I called on old dear Santa Claus to see what I could see
He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me
Now Santa is a busy man he has no time for play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You better write your letter now and mail it right away
Because he's getting ready his reindeers and his sleigh

[Chorus]
You'd better watch out you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list he's checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out whose naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 1]
He sees when you are sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
Oh you'd better watch out you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Bridge]
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too -

[Chorus]
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 2]
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toyland all around the Christmas tree

[Chorus]
So! You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
""They've got cars big as bars they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
""I could have been someone""
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out

Does a ton up on his sleigh
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day

So here it is Merry Xmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

Are you waiting for the family to arrive
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best
Then she's up and rock 'n' rolling with the rest

What will your daddy do when he sees your mama kissing Santa Claus A-ha

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Then all the reindeer loved him
And they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!""

[Verse 1]
Last December when we were together
I remember prayin' it was forever
Didn't know like the snow our love would melt away
Spring went by and then the summer started
Mid-July I was still brokenhearted
Autumn leaves have left the trees but these feelings still remain
Seems I'm not forgetting you as quickly as I wanted to
Now winter's on its way

[Chorus]
Yeah at Christmas I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me evergreen
It's a time of joy but for me it's bittersweet
At Christmas I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be
C'est la vie
Yeah I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas

[Verse 2]
I know moving on is never easy
Wish my heart could change like the seasons
Someone send a happy end to my winter's tale
Now I'm building me a great big snowman
When I hold him we'll be two hearts frozen
All alone I'll keep him cold to make sure that he stays
I am trying my very best
But now I face the hardest test
As I've no festive cheer

[Chorus]
Yeah at Christmas I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me evergreen
It's a time of joy but for me it's bittersweet
At Christmas I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be

Yeah I've spent all year wishing you were here at--

Can't help but think about you when I'm all alone
Each time I hear Sinatra on my radio

Yeah at Christmas I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me evergreen

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

On the 25th by that fireplace oh-woo-oh

If he will be if he will be here

Instead of shouting all night long like we do
We keep fighting in the street
When we should be home wrapped in the sheets
Putting presents underneath the tree for me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we had our fair share
Of breaking up and making up
I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up no

[Chorus]
If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll be together
Baby all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

[Verse 2]
It hasn't been the greatest year
But through thick and thin we made it here
Just keep holding onto me and I'll hold you
But we made it through the hardest part
And I followed you the brightest star
I just wanna be where you are right where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we've had our fair share
Of breaking up yeah and making up
But I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up no don't

[Chorus]
If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll have together
Baby all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

[Bridge]
A-a-all I want yeah
A-a-all I want yeah
A-a-all I want yeah
A-a-all I want yeah

[Outro]
If we can make it through December (A-a-all I want yeah)
Every New Year we'll be together (A-a-all I want yeah)

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Every year around this time I start to think about you
We're really gonna have another Christmas Eve without you
I can't believe it's been so long
Everyday finds a way to make me think about you
Like today when we were picking out the tree without you
I can't believe it's been so long

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh we miss you like hell all the stories that you'd tell
'Bout the boat that you built but never got to sail
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here we would

[Chorus]
Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here

[Verse 2]
Another year has passed and now it's time for buying the presents
I even got you one forgetting you're not gonna get it
I can't believe it's been so long
This time around we'll try to smile 'cause we're sick of tears
Most days are easy now but it gets hard this time of year
I can't believe you're really gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh we miss you like hell all the stories that you'd tell
'Bout the boat that you built but never got to sail
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here we would

[Chorus]
Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still
Wild and free I've got so many memories
Soon time too will take it all of 'em from me
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
When it's dark and it's cold everyone is coming home
I just wish you could know that's when we're missin' you the most
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here we would

[Chorus]
Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still
Wild and free I've got so many memories
Soon time too will take it all of 'em from me
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here

[Verse 1: Kelly Clarkson & John Legend]
I really can't stay (Baby it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But I can call you a ride)
This evening has been (I'm so glad that you dropped in)
So very nice (Time spent with you is paradise)
My momma will start to worry (I'll call the car and tell him to hurry)
My daddy will be pacing the floor (Wait what are you still livin' home for?)
So really I'd better scurry (Your driver his name is Murray)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Oh we're both adults so who's keepin' score?)
What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice)
If I have one more drink? (It's your body and your choice)
Ooh you really know how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To cast a spell (One look at you and then I fell)
I ought to say ""No no no sir"" (Then you really ought to go go go)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (Well Murray he just pulled up outside)

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson John Legend & Both]
Oh I really can't stay
(I understand baby)
Baby it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson & John Legend]
I simply should go (Text me when you get home)
Oh I'm supposed to say no (Mm I guess that's respectable)
This welcome has been (I've been lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (But you better go before it storms)
My sister will be suspicious (Well gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Oh he loves my music baby I'm sure)
My gossipy neighbor is vicious (I'm a genie tell me what your wish is)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Oh that's somethin' we should probably explore)
I've got to get home (Oh baby I'm well aware)
Say lend me a coat (Oh keep it girl I don't care)
You've really been grand (I feel it when you touch my hands)
But don't you see? (I want you to stay it's not up to me)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Well they can talk but what do they know?)
At least there will be plenty implied (Oh let them mind their business and go-)
Uh ma'am I really can't stay

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson & Both]
Baby just go
It's cold baby
It's cold baby
But ooh I don't wanna go
It's cold outside

Gather near to us once more

If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Once upon a time
But now we're frozen hanging by a thread
Can we wait a minute?
Or can we just try to try?
'Cause my favorite day is coming up ahead

Darling I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year

Please can we make it to Christmas?
Can we make it to Christmas?

Don't know what I'll say to Dad when he sees the empty chair

Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 1]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home

Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go

All through the year we've waited
Waited through spring and fall
To hear silver bells ringing
And winter time bringing the happiest season of all

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos oh

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times
Many ways merry Christmas to you

And so we're offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times
Many ways merry Christmas merry Christmas merry Christmas to you

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
We're walking in a winter wonderland

And gone away (gone away) is the bluebird (is the bluebird)
But here to stay stay stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
We're walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on (later on! ) we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire babe
We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job

[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Oh mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
But baby don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no no no
Aw baby it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see no no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!

We waited all through the year
For the day to appear
When we could be together in harmony

You know the time will come
Peace on earth for everyone
And we can live forever in a world where we are free
Let it shine for you and me

There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday

To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

We're all as one tonight
Makes no difference if you're black or white
'cause we can sing together in harmony

I know it's not too late
The world would be a better place
If we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
Send a message loud and clear

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air - you know it's everywhere
There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas every day

To see the joy in the children's eyes

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above

Can you send some happiness
With my best to the rest of the people
Of the east and the west?
And maybe every once in a while
Give my grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season of smile

It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
Let me meet a boy one day
That wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness

Ringing through the night shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
A song a song high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace warm mighty king
Do you know what I know
A child a child shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say
A child a child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light

But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well

Soon the bells will start
And the thing that'll make them ring is the carol that you'll sing
Right within your heart

And I always will

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

Oh I'm dreaming of a Christmas I used to know
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
May your days be merry and bright
And all your Christmases be white

[Intro]
Oh Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him mine mine
Oh Santa
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him mine mine
Oh Santa

[Verse 1]
Santa
If you get this letter
Won't you help me out?
I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now
And I don't know how
You do the things you do while I sleep on Christmas eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this burn inside
And I just can't take it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night

[Chorus]
Ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night

[Verse 2]
Oh Santa
I heard that it's really gonna snow this year
So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really really really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
’Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on oh Kris Kringle send me help

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night?

[Chorus]
Ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night

Oh Santa
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas

[Verse 3]
Oh Santa Claus
If you get this letter please don't make me wait
'Cause all December I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies

[Pre-Chorus 3]
The trees all sparkly and gold
But inside I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas?

[Chorus]
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho ho ho

Stockings are hung with care
As children sleep with one eye open
Well now there's more than toys at stake
Cause I'm older now but not done hoping

[Verse 2]
The twinkling of the lights
The scent of candles fill the household
'Ol Saint Nick has taken flight
With a heart on board so please be careful

[Pre-Chorus]
Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Verse 3]
A tree that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but this evening can be a holy night
So cozy on up by the fireplace
And dim those Christmas lights

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

I'm here I'm yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving

[Chorus]
Just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater
Walk proudly to the mistletoe tonight
I want something to last forever
So kiss me on this cold December Night

Call it the season of giving

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm

Winter's on the wind
Sings familiar melodies
Chill starts setting in
Silver bells are casting spells
It all comes back again
Lay your troubles down
Let me hold you

Now all the signs appear
The Christmas trees the memories
They bring this time of year
Ghosts of winters past
Come in and whisper in your ear
Don't listen to a word they've told you

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm
Start a fire and feel it glow
As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
You don't have to face the cold alone no more
I'll keep you warm

It's only you and me
The world outside is frozen white
I know it's hard to see
I'll be your candle
Be your light
Be anything you need
Star above the night to guide you

To find the highest bow
Hang up your regrets and
Let them fade into the sound
The angel choirs and roaring fires
Magic lost and found
Love is all around
Let it find you

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm
Start a fire and feel it glow
As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
You don't have to face the cold alone no more
I'll keep you warm

Through the frightful weather
I will hold you tight
We'll stay warm together
This December night
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm

As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
Now I know you've faced the cold alone before
But you don't have to face the cold alone no more
Because I'll keep you warm...

Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

Are you sure you got the room to spare inside
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best
Then she's up and rock 'n' rolling with the rest

[Hook]

What will your daddy do when he sees your mama kissing Santa Claus A-ha

[Verse 3]
Are you hanging up your stocking on your wall
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made
When you land upon your head
Then you bin slayed

[Hook x3]

Once in royal David's city
Stood a lowly cattle shed
Where a mother laid her Baby
In a manger for His bed:
Mary was that mother mild
Jesus Christ her little Child

He came down to earth from heaven
Who is God and Lord of all
And His shelter was a stable
And His cradle was a stall;
With the poor and mean and lowly
Lived on earth our Saviour holy

And our eyes at last shall see Him
Through His own redeeming love;
For that Child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heaven above
And He leads His children on
To the place where He is gone
Not in that poor lowly stable
With the oxen standing by
We shall see Him; but in heaven
Set at God's right hand on high;
When like stars His children crowned
All in white shall wait around

O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see Thee lie
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in Thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the Holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth

How silently how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven
No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him
Still the dear Christ enters in

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the Blessed Child
Where misery cries out to Thee
Son of the Mother mild
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door
The dark night wakes the glory breaks
And Christmas comes once more

O Holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel

Going through the hills on a night all starry
On the way to Bethlehem
Far away I heard a shepherd boy piping
On the way to Bethlehem

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for joy that Christ the newborn King
Is come to bring us peace on earth
And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem.""

""Tell me shepherd boy piping tunes so merrily
On the way to Bethlehem
Who will hear your tunes on these hills so lonely
On the way to Bethlehem?

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for the joy that Christ the newborn King
Is come to bring peace on earth
And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem.""

""None may hear my pipes on these hills so lonely
On the way to Bethlehem;
But a King will hear me play sweet lullabies
When I get to Bethlehem.""

Angels in the sky came down from on high
Hovered over the manger where the babe was lying
Cradled in the arms of his mother Mary
Sleeping now at Bethlehem

""Where is the new King shepherd boy piping merrily
Is He there at Bethlehem?""
""I will find Him soon by the star shining brightly
In the sky o'vr Bethlehem.""

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for joy that Christ the king of Kings
Is come to bring us peace on earth
And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem.""

""May I come with you shepherd boy piping merrily
Come with you to Bethlehem?
Pay my homage too at the new King's cradle
Is it far to Bethlehem?""

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for joy that Christ the newborn King
Is born in the stable yonder born for you and me.""

You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donder and Blitzen.
But do you recall?
The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer

And their eyes full of tinsel and fire

They sold me a dream of Christmas
They sold me a Silent Night
They told me a fairy story
'Till I believed in the Israelite
And I believed in Father Christmas
And I looked to the Sky with excited eyes
'Till I woke with a yawn in the first Light of dawn
And I saw him and through his disguise

I wish you a hopeful Christmas
I wish you a brave New Year
All anguish pain and sadness
Leave your Heart and let your road be clear

And learn to lie your lane;
For I'm ga'n oer the sea Fair Annie
A braw bride to bring hame.
Wi her I will get gowd and gear;
Wi you I neer got nane.
""But wha will bake my bridal bread
Or brew my bridal ale?
And wha will welcome my brisk bride
That I bring oer the dale?""
""It's I will bake your bridal bread
And brew your bridal ale
And I will welcome your brisk bride
That you bring oer the dale.""
""But she that welcomes my brisk bride
Maun gang like maiden fair;
She maun lace on her robe sae jimp
And braid her yellow hair.""
""But how can I gang maiden-like
When maiden I am nane?
Have I not born seven sons to thee
And am with child again?""
She's taen her young son in her arms
Another in her hand
And she's up to the highest tower
To see him come to land.

And look oer yon sea-strand
And see your father's new-come bride
Before she come to land.""

Come frae the castle wa!

And the topmast and the mainmast
Shone like the silver free.
And she's gane down and farther down
The bride's ship to behold
And the topmast and the mainmast
They shone just like the gold.
She's taen her seven sons in her hand
I wot she didna fail;
She met Lord Thomas and his bride
As they came oer the dale.
""You're welcome to your house Lord Thomas
You're welcome to your land;
You're welcome with your fair ladye
That you lead by the hand.

With white bread and with wine
And aye she drank the wan water
To had her colour fine.
And he's taen down the silk napkin
Hung on a silver pin
And aye he wipes the tear trickling
A' down her cheik and chin.
And aye he turn'd him round about
And smil'd amang his men;

Or her that's new come hame?""
When bells were rung and mass was sung
And a' men bound to bed

To their chamber they were gaed.
Annie made her bed a little forbye
To hear what they might say;
""And ever alas!"" Fair Annie cried
""That I should see this day!
""Gin my seven sons were seven young rats
Running on the castle wa
And I were a grey cat mysell
I soon would worry them a'.
""Gin my seven sons were seven young hares
Running oer yon lilly lee
And I were a grew hound mysell

And wae and sad Fair Annie sat
And drearie was her sang
And ever as she sobbd and grat

""My gown is on"" said the new-come bride
""My shoes are on my feet
And I will to Fair Annie's chamber
And see what gars her greet.
""What ails ye what ails ye Fair Annie
That ye make sic a moan?
Has your wine barrels cast the girds
Or is your white bread gone?
""O wha was't was your father Annie
Or wha was't was your mother?
And had ye ony sister Annie
Or had ye ony brother?""
""The Earl of Wemyss was my father
The Countess of Wemyss my mother;
And a' the folk about the house
To me were sister and brother.
""If the Earl of Wemyss was your father
I wot sae was he mine;
And it shall not be for lack o gowd
That ye your love sall tine.
""For I have seven ships o mine ain
A' loaded to the brim
And I will gie them a' to thee
Wi four to thine eldest son:
But thanks to a' the powers in heaven

In the bleak midwinter frost wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron water like a stone;
Snow had fallen snow on snow snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter long ago
Our god heaven cannot hold him nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The lord God almighty jesus christ
Angels and archangels may have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
But his mother only in her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss
What can I give him poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb;
If I were a wise man I would do my part;
Yet what I can I give him: give my heart

Laden with fruit and always green:

In Jesus Christ the apple tree

For happiness I long have sought
And pleasure dearly I have bought:
I missed of all; but now I see
'Tis found in Christ the apple tree

I'm weary with my former toil
Here I will sit and rest awhile:
Under the shadow I will be
Of Jesus Christ the apple tree

This fruit doth make my soul to thrive
It keeps my dying faith alive;
Which makes my soul in haste to be
With Jesus Christ the apple tree

I.

       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep mine Holy One!
My flesh my Lord!—what name? I do not know
A name that seemeth not too high or low
       &nbsp       &nbspToo far from me or heaven:
My Jesus that is best! that word being given
By the majestic angel whose command
Was softly as a man's beseeching said
When I and all the earth appeared to stand
       &nbsp       &nbspIn the great overflow
Of light celestial from his wings and head.
       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep my saving One!


II.

And art Thou come for saving baby-browed
And speechless Being—art Thou come for saving?
The palm that grows beside our door is bowed
By treadings of the low wind from the south
A restless shadow through the chamber waving:
Upon its bough a bird sings in the sun
But Thou with that close slumber on Thy mouth
Dost seem of wind and sun already weary.
Art come for saving O my weary One?

III.

Perchance this sleep that shutteth out the dreary
Earth-sounds and motions opens on Thy soul
       &nbspHigh dreams on fire with God;
High songs that make the pathways where they roll
More bright than stars do theirs; and visions new
Of Thine eternal Nature's old abode.
       &nbspSuffer this mother's kiss
       &nbspBest thing that earthly is
To glide the music and the glory through
Nor narrow in Thy dream the broad upliftings
       &nbspOf any seraph wing.
Thus noiseless thus. Sleep sleep my dreaming One!

IV.

The slumber of His lips meseems to run
Through my lips to mine heart to all its shiftings
Of sensual life bringing contrariousness
In a great calm. I feel I could lie down
As Moses did and die[7]—and then live most.
I am 'ware of you heavenly Presences
That stand with your peculiar light unlost
Each forehead with a high thought for a crown
Unsunned i' the sunshine! I am 'ware. Ye throw
No shade against the wall! How motionless
Ye round me with your living statuary
While through your whiteness in and outwardly
Continual thoughts of God appear to go
Like light's soul in itself. I bear I bear
To look upon the dropt lids of your eyes
Though their external shining testifies
To that beatitude within which were
Enough to blast an eagle at his sun:
I fall not on my sad clay face before ye—
       &nbsp       &nbspI look on His. I know
My spirit which dilateth with the woe
       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspOf His mortality
       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspMay well contain your glory.
       &nbsp       &nbspYea drop your lids more low.
Ye are but fellow-worshippers with me!
       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep my worshipped One!


V.

We sate among the stalls at Bethlehem;
The dumb kine from their fodder turning them
       &nbspSoftened their hornèd faces
       &nbspTo almost human gazes
       &nbspToward the newly Born:
The simple shepherds from the star-lit brooks
       &nbspBrought visionary looks
As yet in their astonied hearing rung
       &nbspThe strange sweet angel-tongue:
The magi of the East in sandals worn
       &nbspKnelt reverent sweeping round
With long pale beards their gifts upon the ground
       &nbspThe incense myrrh and gold
These baby hands were impotent to hold:
So let all earthlies and celestials wait
       &nbspUpon Thy royal state.
       &nbspSleep sleep my kingly One!

VI.

I am not proud—meek angels ye invest
New meeknesses to hear such utterance rest
On mortal lips—""I am not proud""—not proud!
Albeit in my flesh God sent His Son
Albeit over Him my head is bowed
As others bow before Him still mine heart
Bows lower than their knees. O centuries
That roll in vision your futurities
       &nbsp       &nbspMy future grave athwart—
Whose murmurs seem to reach me while I keep
       &nbsp       &nbspWatch o'er this sleep—
Say of me as the Heavenly said—""Thou art
The blessedest of women!""—blessedest
Not holiest not noblest no high name
Whose height misplaced may pierce me like a shame
When I sit meek in heaven!
       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspFor me for me
God knows that I am feeble like the rest!
I often wandered forth more child than maiden
Among the midnight hills of Galilee
       &nbsp       &nbspWhose summits looked heaven-laden
Listening to silence as it seemed to be
God's voice so soft yet strong so fain to press
Upon my heart as heaven did on the height
And waken up its shadows by a light
And show its vileness by a holiness.
Then I knelt down most silent like the night
       &nbsp       &nbspToo self-renounced for fears
Raising my small face to the boundless blue
Whose stars did mix and tremble in my tears:
God heard them falling after with His dew.

VII.

So seeing my corruption can I see
This Incorruptible now born of me
This fair new Innocence no sun did chance
To shine on (for even Adam was no child)
Created from my nature all defiled
This mystery from out mine ignorance—
Nor feel the blindness stain corruption more
Than others do or I did heretofore?
Can hands wherein such burden pure has been
Not open with the cry ""unclean unclean""
More oft than any else beneath the skies?
       &nbsp       &nbspAh King ah Christ ah son!
The kine the shepherds the abasèd wise
       &nbsp       &nbspMust all less lowly wait
       &nbsp       &nbspThan I upon Thy state.
       &nbspSleep sleep my kingly One!

VIII.

Art Thou a King then? Come His universe
Come crown me Him a King!
Pluck rays from all such stars as never fling
       &nbspTheir light where fell a curse
And make a crowning for this kingly brow!—
What is my word? Each empyreal star
       &nbsp       &nbspSits in a sphere afar
       &nbsp       &nbspIn shining ambuscade:
       &nbsp       &nbspThe child-brow crowned by none
       &nbsp       &nbspKeeps its unchildlike shade.
       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep my crownless One!

IX.

Unchildlike shade! No other babe doth wear
An aspect very sorrowful as Thou.
No small babe-smiles my watching heart has seen
To float like speech the speechless lips between
No dovelike cooing in the golden air
No quick short joys of leaping babyhood.
       &nbsp       &nbspAlas our earthly good
In heaven thought evil seems too good for Thee;
       &nbsp       &nbspYet sleep my weary One!

X.

And then the drear sharp tongue of prophecy
With the dread sense of things which shall be done
Doth smite me inly like a sword: a sword?
That ""smites the Shepherd."" Then I think aloud
The words ""despised""—""rejected""—every word
Recoiling into darkness as I view
       &nbsp       &nbspThe Darling on my knee.
Bright angels—move not—lest ye stir the cloud
Betwixt my soul and His futurity!
I must not die with mother's work to do
       &nbsp       &nbspAnd could not live-and see.

XI.

       &nbspIt is enough to bear
       &nbspThis image still and fair
       &nbspThis holier in sleep
       &nbspThan a saint at prayer
       &nbspThis aspect of a child
       &nbspWho never sinned or smiled;
       &nbspThis Presence in an infant's face;
       &nbspThis sadness most like love
       &nbspThis love than love more deep
       &nbspThis weakness like omnipotence
       &nbspIt is so strong to move.
       &nbspAwful is this watching place
       &nbspAwful what I see from hence—
       &nbspA king without regalia
       &nbspA God without the thunder
       &nbspA child without the heart for play;
       &nbspAy a Creator rent asunder
       &nbspFrom His first glory and cast away
       &nbspOn His own world for me alone
To hold in hands created crying—Son!

XII.

       &nbspThat tear fell not on Thee
Beloved yet thou stirrest in thy slumber!
Thou stirring not for glad sounds out of number
Which through the vibratory palm-trees run
       &nbspFrom summer-wind and bird
       &nbspSo quickly hast thou heard
       &nbspA tear fall silently?
       &nbspWak'st thou O loving One?—

And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing ""Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" We'll say ""No man""
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Over the ground lies the mantle of light
A heaven of diamond in the lovely night
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then give him a name and call him Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" And then we'll say ""No man""
But now you can do the job whenever you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream sittin' by the fire
To face unafraid all the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking walking in a winter wonderland

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo-hoo
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up it's grand
Just holding your hand

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like birds of a feather would be

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a Christmas party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop pop pop

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
As they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fires gloosy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says let it snow let it snow let it snow

Let it snow!

Oooooh wee goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says let it snow let it snow let it snow

I don't care!

The weather outside is frightful
But that fire is mmm-delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are way down low
So let it snow let it snow let it snow!

Let it snow!

When we finally say goodnight
How I'll hate going out in a storm
But if you'll only hold me yight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus

You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel

You're a monster Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole

You're a vile one Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile Mr. Grinch
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile

[Verse 4]
You're a foul one Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk Mr. Grinch
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows and I quote:
""Stink. Stank. Stunk.""

[Verse 5]
You're a rotter Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment
Of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled-up knots

[Verse 6]
You nauseate me Mr. Grinch
With a nauseous super-naus
You're a crooked jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked hoss Mr. Grinch
You're a three-decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich

Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history
(Repeat)

Come a little closer children I've got a story to tell
(oh gee)
It's about a man you've heard of and I knew him well
(How well?)

He was born on a cold winter's morning
And went on to gain great fame
But may I begin my story
And refer to him by name?
(Please do)

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul (ooooh)
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman made the children smile they say
And were they surprised when he rolled his eyes
And he came to life that day!

There must of been some magic
In that ol' silk cap they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal!
Were they surprised when he rolled his eyes and he came to life that day!

(But Uncle Jimmy you didn't finish your story.)
I know I just paused to catch my breath
(What happened to frosty when he came to life that day?)
Well he got in a lot of trouble you see?

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun before I melt away
(Where'd he go?)
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there and around the square
Sayin' ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler ""Stop!""

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry
I'll be back again someday!

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at that Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""You Hoo""
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go
Let's look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two

What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste haste to bring him laud
The babe the son of Mary

Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian fear: for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
Nails spear shall pierce Him through
The Cross be borne for me for you;
Hail hail the Word made flesh
The Babe the Son of Mary

So bring him incense gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him
Raise raise the song on high
The Virgin sing her lullaby:
Joy joy for Christ is born
The Babe the Son of Mary

Oh the rising of the sun and the running of the deer
The playing of the merry organ sweet singing in the choir

The holly bears a blossom as white as lily flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to be our sweet savior

The holly bears a berry as red as any blood
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to do poor sinners good

The holly bears a prickle as sharp as any thorn
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ on Christmas Day in the morn

The holly bears a bark as bitter as any gall
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ for to redeem us all

Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

[Verse 1: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I really can't stay (But baby it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But baby it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby it's bad out there)
Say what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat your hair looks swell)
I ought to say ""No no no sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Oh baby don't hold out)
Baby it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I simply must go (But baby it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But baby it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But baby you'd freeze out there)
Say lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Get over that cold out)
Baby it's cold
Baby it's cold outside

One minute to midnight

One minute to say good-bye
Before we say hello

Let's start the new year right
Twelve o'clock tonight
When they dim the light
Let's begin

Kissing the old year out
Kissing the new year in

Let's watch the old year die
With a fond good-bye
And our hopes as high
As a kite

How can our love go wrong if
We start the new year right?

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

For Christ is born of Mary and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together proclaim thy holy birth
And praises sing to God the king and peace to men on earth

[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
""They've got cars big as bars they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
""I could have been someone""
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping
This this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste haste to bring him laud
The babe the son of Mary
Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding
Good Christian fear for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
So bring Him incense gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
This this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste haste to bring him laud
The babe the son of Mary

I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat off with my glove
Who needs an overcoat I'm burning with love

My heart's on fire and the fire gets higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

My mother will start to worry (Call her so she knows that you're coming)

Father will be pacing the floor (Better get your car a-humming)

Should I use the front or back door? (Which one are you pulling towards more?)

What is this drink? (Pomegranate La Croix)

I wish I knew how (Maybe I can help you out)

I ought to say no no no (you reserve the right to say no)

Say where is my coat (I'll go and grab it my dear)

You've really been grand (We'll have to do this again)

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees O hear the angels voices
O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night O night divine

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friend

He knows our need to our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever
His power and glory evermore proclaim

The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friend

He knows our need to our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever
His power and glory evermore proclaim
O night divine O night O night divine

What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom Angels greet
With anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding
Good Christians fear
For sinners here
The silent Word is pleading

This this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste haste to bring Him laud
The babe the Son of Mary

So bring Him incense gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own Him
The King of Kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

Nails spears shall pierce Him through
The cross He bore for me for you
Hail hail the word made flesh
The babe the Son of Mary

Been an awful good girl
Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

A '54 convertible too
Light blue
I'll wait up for you dear

Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check off my Christmas list

I want a yacht and really that's not
A lot
Been an angel all year

The deed
To a platinum mine

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

A ring
And I don't mean on the phone
Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight

And this song of mine
In three-quarter time

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart

I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry - Beautiful what's your hurry?
Father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful please don't hurry
Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think - Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell - I'll take your hat your hair looks swell

I ought to say no no no sir - Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Ah but it's cold outside

I simply must go - But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no - But baby it's cold outside
This welcome has been - How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm - Look out that window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious - God your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon the tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Ooh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more - Never such a blizzard before

I got to get home - But baby you'd freeze out there
Say lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - I thrill when you touch my hand
Why don't you see - How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that hold out
Ah but it's cold outside
Oh baby it's cold outside
Oh baby it's cold outside

I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
They won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me

I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

(I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin')
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

[Verse 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

[Hook 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Outro]
So it's Christmas once more

Oh by gosh by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Tasty pheasants Christmas presents
Countrysides covered with snow
Oh by gosh by jingle
It's time for carols and Kris Kringle
Overeating merry greetings
From relatives you don't know
Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
You'll hear voices by starlight
Singing a Yuletide hymn
Oh by gosh by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Fancy ties an' granny's pies
An' folks stealin' a kiss or two
As they whisper ""Merry Christmas"" to you
Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
You'll hear voices by starlight
Singing a Yuletide hymn
Oh by gosh by golly

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Verse 1]
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
It's the time that every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer?
Does a ton-up on his sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Verse 2]
Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell you
That old songs are the best?
Then she's up and rock-'n'-rolling with the rest

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Sigue]
What will your daddy do when he sees your momma kissing Santa Claus?

[Verse 2]
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head then you've been slayed

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudy
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudy the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
That he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Thumpetty thump thump thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump over the hills of snow
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said ""Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin' ""Catch me if you can""
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
He only paused a moment
When he heard him holler ""Stop""
Because ol' Frosty the snowman he had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day I'll be back again some day
I'll be back again some day""

O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

The thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees oh hear the angel voices
O night divine O night when Christ was born

O night divine
O night
O night divine

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
O night divine O night when Christ was born

O night divine

[Verse 1]
Stockings are hung with care
As children sleep with one eye open
Well now there's more than toys at stake
Cause I'm older now but not done hoping

[Verse 2]
The twinkling of the lights
The scent of candles fill the household
'Ol Saint Nick has taken flight
With a heart on board so please be careful

[Pre-Chorus]
Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Verse 3]
A tree that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but this evening can be a holy night
So cozy on up by the fireplace
And dim those Christmas lights

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

They call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours

[Chorus]
Just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater
Walk proudly to the mistletoe tonight
I want something to last forever
So kiss me on this cold December Night

[Closing]
Call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours for the taking
Call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

[Verse 1]
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
No I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
There's no sense in hanging stockings
There upon the fireplace
Cause Santa he won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day


[Hook]
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
Girl what can I do?
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

[Verse 2]
And all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really love
Won't you please bring my baby to me...

[Chorus]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
No I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own
More that you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...
Is you...

Meeting smile after smile

Ring-a-ling hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day
Strings of streetlights even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the north pole to spend a holiday

I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me so

You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Then kids in Girl and Boyland will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Now Santa is a busy man He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh so

You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watched their flock by night
And see a bright new shining star
And hear a choir sing
The music seem to come from afar

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
And find no place to borne she child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Silent night holy night!
All is calm All is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so Tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight!
Glories stream from heaven afar;
Heavenly hosts sing Al-le-lu-ia!
Christ the Savior is born!
Christ the Savior is born!

Silent night holy night!
Wondrous star lend thy light!
With the angels let us sing
Alleluia to our King!
Christ the Savior is here
Jesus the Savior is here!

Silent night Holy night!
Son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth;
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Sing sweet and low a lullaby till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem
While wisemen follow through the dark a star that beckons them
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem

A little child shall lead them the prophets said of old
Through storm and tempest heed them until the bell is tolled
Sing sweet and low your lullaby till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem

Sing sweet and low your lullaby till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem

Peace on earth can it be

Every child must be made aware
Every child must be made to care
Care enough for his fellow man
To give all the love that he can

I pray my wish will come true
For my child and your child too
He'll see the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace live in peace again

[Verse 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

[Hook 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Outro]
So it's Christmas once more

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

Oh my Lord they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)

That's what Christmas means to me my love

Oh yeah ha ha
I feel like running wild
(Running wild)
As anxious as a little child
Greet you neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby
(wish you a Merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the coming year
(Happiness in the coming year)
Oh baby
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill the tree with angel hair
And pretty pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

[Chorus]
All these things and more baby
(all these things and more baby)
Whoa
That's what Christmas means to me my love

Lots and lots of snow
Alright

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

And so I'm offering this simple phrase

[Verse 1]
Hello Dan it's Joe here
I hope you're keeping well
It's the 21st of December
And now they're ringing the last bells
If I get good behaviour
I'll be out of here by July
Won't you kiss my kids on Christmas Day?
Please don't let 'em cry for me

[Verse 2]
I guess the brothers are driving down from Queensland
And Stella's flying in from the coast
They say it's gonna be a hundred degrees even more maybe
But that won't stop the roast
Who's gonna make the gravy now?
I bet it won't taste the same
Just add flour salt a little red wine
And don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce
For sweetness and that extra tang

[Chorus 1]
And give my love to Angus and to Frank and Dolly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry I screwed up this time
And look after Rita I'll be thinking of her
Early Christmas morning when I'm standing in line

[Verse 3]
I hear Mary's got a new boyfriend
I hope he can hold his own
Do you remember the last one? What was his name again?
Ahh just a little too much cologne
And Roger you know I'm even gonna miss Roger
'Cause there's sure as hell no one in here I want to fight

[Chorus 2]
Oh praise the Baby Jesus have a Merry Christmas
I'm really gonna miss it all the treasure and the trash
And later in the evening I can just imagine
You'll put on Junior Murvin and push the tables back

[Chorus 3]
And you'll dance with Rita I know you really like her
Just don't hold her too close
Oh brother please don't stab me in the back
I didn't mean to say that it's just my mind it plays up
Multiplies each matter turns imagination into fact

[Chorus 4]
You know I love her badly she's the one to save me
I'm gonna make some gravy I'm gonna taste the fat
Ahh tell her that I'm sorry yeah I love her badly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry and kiss the sleepy children for me
You know one of these days I'll be making gravy
I'll be making plenty I'm gonna pay 'em all back

I think I saw ol' Santa through my window Christmas eve
My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe
It must've been ol' Santa 'cause I saw his big red hat
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that Oh no
I know my Mom and Dad can't fly like that

And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door
The same ol' Christmas trick my dad had played since I was four
He stands outside my bedroom yelling 'Ho! Ho! Ho!' because
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus no way
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus

I think my daddy sees me
Peeking from my door
But he pretends he's Santa anyway
Every year he tries to fool me
But I'm a big boy now I don't believe in Santa or his sleigh...
No way!

So I went back to my bed and I curled up nice and tight
I stared out of my window and I looked into the night
And then all of a sudden through my window I could see
Santa Claus was flying by and smiling at me

Chorus:
Santa Claus Santa Claus
It must've been ol' Santa Claus
Santa Claus Santa Claus
Happy 'Ho! Ho! Ho!' to you

Then I heard ol' Rudolph tellin' me to come outside
He told me that ol' Santa wanted me to take a ride
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh
And then ol' Santa took me up and away
Santa took me up up and away

We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said
'Little boys like you should be in bed'

So I hollered 'Ho! Ho! Ho!'
And I put on Santa's hat
Then he let me hold the reins a while
We pulled up to my window
And I jumped back in my room
And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile

When I woke up Christmas morning (well) it was clear and bright
My parents said my window had blown open in the night
I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat
And they asked me where I got my big red hat Yeah yeah
They asked me where I got my big red hat

Chorus

Happy Ho! Ho! Ho! to you! (18x)

Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

[Verse 1]
Thinking of you
Thinking of all that you do to me
Out of the blue
All that I hope
But live without it
Sail into view
And put a light that moved right through me
It's all coming true
And now every day's like Christmas

[Chorus]
Until you every day was ordinary it's true
And now every day's like Christmas

[Verse 2]
All 'cos of you
All now there's angels all around me
I was down and disused
And now I can't believe you found me
Thinking of you
Thinking of all the storms we weathered
Thanks for pulling me through
I hope we'll always be together

[Chorus]
'Cause it's true
Every day before was heavy
And now every day's like Christmas

[Chorus 2]
Oh you're just extraordinary
And all before my hopes are buried
Now my dreams are coming very true

Now I'm falling I'm falling
I'm falling into you

It's true you make every day like Christmas

Verse 1:
The cold wind is blowin' and the streets are getting dark
I'm writin' you a letter and I don't know where to start
The bells will be ringin' Saint John the Divine
I get a little lonely every year around this time
The music plays all night in Little Italy
The lights will be going up on old Rockefeller tree
People window shopping on Fifth Avenue
All I want for Christmas is you

Chorus:
I've got to know (Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Where do the lonely hearts go(Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Oh cause' nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas

Verse 2:
Things are different since you've been here last
Childhood dreaming is a thing of the past
Maybe you can bring us some hope this year
Visions of sugar plums have disappeared
Do you remember sleigh riding in the snow
And dancing all night to ""Baby Please Come Home""
Today's celebration is bittersweet
There's mothers and children in the street

Chorus:
I wanna know (Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go (Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Cause' nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas

Verse 3:
I'm all grown up but I'm the same you'll see
I'm writing you this letter cause I still believe
Dear Santa I've been good this year
Can't you stay a little while with me right here

Ooooooh
I've got to know

Saxophone Instrumental

(Tell me) I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go

Oooooh Because nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas
Oooh nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas
Oooohhh nobody ought to be
Oooh yeah on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
All alone on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Tell me I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Don't leave me alone (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
All alone  on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Tell me I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Where do they all go (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Nobody on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)

'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]

On the 25th by that fireplace oh-woo-oh

If he will be if he will be here

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

[Hook 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

And since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Man it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh the fire is slowly dying

We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
Ahh and don't look down

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong ding dong
Ding dong ding dong
Ding dong ding dong

The party's on
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The mood is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
Ohh and that's enough

We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

Happy golden days of yore

Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk

And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring

I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Oh mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
But baby don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no no no
Aw baby it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see no no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!

And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

Join in any reindeer games

Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
Thought we belong together
At least that's what you said
I should have known better
You broke my heart again
Boy you blew it
How could you do it do it?
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special

[Bridge]
How could you leave Christmas morning?
You broke my heart with no warning
Boy you blew it
How could you do it do it?
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special

[Outro]
This is our last last Christmas
You broke my heart
Last last Christmas
You broke my heart
This year to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special
I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget what you did last December
You left my heart a mess
You blew it
You do it do it?

Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know

How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say

He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day

So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow (Rudolph)
In a one-horse open sleigh (today)
O'er the fields we go (Rudolph)
Laughing all the way (today)

Bells on bob-tail ring
Making our spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells jingle-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

I love those JINGLE bells
Those holiday JINGLE bells
All those happy JINGLE BE double LLES
I love those JINGLE bells

Jingle all the way

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright

A sleighing song tonight

Echo: Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh O
Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead

[Verse 1]
Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 2]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Bridge]
Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more nights on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep

A little girl made a great big wish
To feel the world full of happiness

At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness?

With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Get my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style

Pre-Chorus:
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can know some happiness with me

Shake it up

Wake up the happiness
Come on you all

Christmas coming around again eh?
Yeah I mean it must be nearly a year since the last one
Oh it's a good twelve months
Yeah yeah
You getting anything for your Granny this year?
Well I thought about it I couldn't be bothered
Well it's the thought that counts innit
Yeah that's how I see it
What do you fancy for Christmas then
Kim Wilde as usual kidding myself though arent't I
It's hopeless really it's pathetic I suppose in a way
It is yeah - hello who is this?
Merry Christmas Melvyn
It can't be
Come on Mel how about pulling a cracker
By the look of you darling I think I already have
Get it

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple try to stop
Come on Melly-pops

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
Pumpkin pie anyone?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
This is so corny
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Wow I am in the most almighty Christmas groove
I haven't had this much fun
Since ""Two little boys"" was number one
If my friends could see me now
How do I look?
Ridiculous
You little tease
A dance Kimberley?

I do love a nice sax break
Yeah me too Kim but let's wait till the record's over
Kim do you think our love will last forever?
No
Couple of years maybe?
No
Do you think we'll make it to the end of the record?
How long is that - exactly?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
All together now
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Excuse me can I sing something now?
Get lost Griff!
Well that's nice...

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Root beer anyone?
Later we'll have pumpkin pie
And we'll do some carolling
There's plenty of pumpkin pie left by the way
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Do you mind Melvyn?
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Wow yeah that was fantastic
Very nice
Let's do it again! One two three four...
Strewth
Five!

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
He overdid it with the pumpkin pie
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Merry Christmas everybody!
Merry Christmas everybody!
Bye Mel it's been really interesting
I'll tell you who I fancy for Christmas
Who's that
Bananarama
Yeah can't help you there I'm afraid
Oh thanks a bundle!

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice as shy
I kept my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me

[Verse 2]
""Merry Christmas"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
And if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 3]
A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Tell me where did we go wrong?
We should be singing Christmas songs
Instead of shouting all night long like we do
We keep fighting in the street
When we should be home wrapped in the sheets
Putting presents underneath the tree for me and you

I know we had our fair share
Of breaking up and making up
I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up no

If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll be together
Baby all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

[Verse 2]
It hasn't been the greatest year
But through thick and thin we made it here
Just keep holding onto me and I'll hold you
But we made it through the hardest part
And I followed you the brightest star
I just wanna be where you are right where you are

Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow

Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

[Verse 1]
There is something special
About this time of year
A Christmas feeling's everywhere
I just got home to join you
I've been away too long (been away too long)
But now I'm back
To share my love
Friends are reunited
One big family
Filled with love
To last throughout the year

[Chorus]
Christmas time time to share our love
Come and join the tidings to the world
Christmas time the best time of the year
Yes it's Christmas time (oh Christmas time)

[Verse 2]
You and me together
Sleigh Ride in the Park
Loving kissing (straight from the heart)
Straight from the heart
Snowflakes falling gently
A smell of chestnuts in the air
And Christmas lights
They gleam across the sky oh it's Christmas time

[Chorus]
Christmas time time to share our love
Come and join the tidings to the world
Christmas time (it's Christmas time) the best time of the year

Take peppermint canes out the cupboard
Up to the attic a box full of lights

Mistletoe and angel's wings
Might be here for a little bit but darling
If it's with you it’s okay with me

[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
""They've got cars big as bars they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
""I could have been someone""
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""Let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day

[Bridge]
Oh a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Outro]
Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

True love that he thinks of

My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year to save me from tears (Ohh)
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Outro]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone I'll give it to someone special
Special...
Someone...

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Tou better watch out better not cry you better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes. he comes
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes. he comes
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for everyone's Christmas joys
Tito had just one desire
That he gets a new guitar
But he wants a guarantee
That it won't play out of key
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Up on the housetop click click click
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
O
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me
Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep
Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
We wish you a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmaswe wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy new year
The jackson 5 wanna wish everyboy a merry merry christmas and a groovy new year
The jackson 5 wanna wish everyboy a merry merry christmas and a groovy new year
We wish you a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmaswe wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy new year

[Verse 1]
Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 1]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Bridge]
Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days untill you coming home
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep

I was lost before you

A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet

With no worries at all

Oh Santa It's been a real hard year (Year)
There just ain't no getting around this life is hard
But look at me I turned out alright
Hey Santa why don't we talk about it? Work it out
Believe me this ain't what I wanted
I love all you kids you know that
Hell I remember when you were just 10 years old
Playing out there in the desert
Just waiting for a sip of that sweet Mojave rain

[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
In the sweet Mojave rain the boy was on his own

Don't shoot me Santa Claus
I've been a clean living boy I promise you

But the children on the block they tease me
I couldn't let them off that easy

They had it coming so why can't you see?
I couldn't turn my cheek no longer
The sun is going down and Christmas is near
Just look the other way and I'll disappear forever
Woo!

Don't shoot me Santa Claus
Well no one else around believes me!
But the children on the street they tease me

""Bah humbug!"" No that's too strong
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy

To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from

Last year ski shop
Encounter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines

So deck those halls trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!

Flashback to springtime saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried we said we'd keep in touch

Didn't of course 'til summertime
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree

Now the calendar's just one page
And of course I am excited
Tonight's the night but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Hardly dashing through the snow
Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-do's
A few cards a few calls
'Cause it's r-s-v-p
No thanks no party lights
It's Christmas Eve gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites

Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go

Forget it it's cold it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?

So on with the boots back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!

""I'm spending this one alone"" he said
""Need a break; this year's been crazy.""
I said ""Me too but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?""

Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending! ""

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!

Are you hanging up your stocking on the wall?
Is it time that every Santa has a ball?
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer?
Does he tug upon a sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best?
And she's up and rock n rolling with the rest
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now it's only just begun
What will your daddy do
When he sees your mamma kissing Santa Claus?
Ahhh ahhh
Ahhh ahhh
Are you hinging up your socking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you rattle down the hillside
In the buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head then you will say
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
It's only just begun
Everybody's having fun

Not in the ghetto

And in the morning you will see all he brings
Don't you worry that their ain't no chimney's in the projects""

Not in the ghetto

But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

[Post-Chorus]
Special
Special
Special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

Can you stop the cavalry?

[Intro (spoken)]
Jimmy I just came back from a lovely trip along the milky way
I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday
I called on old dear Santa Claus to see what I could see
He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me
Now Santa is a busy man he has no time for play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You better write your letter now and mail it right away
Because he's getting ready his reindeers and his sleigh

[Chorus]
You'd better watch out you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list he's checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out whose naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 1]
He sees when you are sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh you'd better watch out you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

Santa Claus is coming to town

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee

[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
""They've got cars big as bars they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
""I could have been someone""
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Then all the reindeer loved him
And they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!""

Last December when we were together
I remember prayin' it was forever
Didn't know like the snow our love would melt away
Spring went by and then the summer started
Mid-July I was still brokenhearted
Autumn leaves have left the trees but these feelings still remain
Seems I'm not forgetting you as quickly as I wanted to
Now winter's on its way

Yeah at Christmas I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me evergreen
It's a time of joy but for me it's bittersweet
At Christmas I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be
C'est la vie
Yeah I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas

I know moving on is never easy
Wish my heart could change like the seasons
Someone send a happy end to my winter's tale
Now I'm building me a great big snowman
When I hold him we'll be two hearts frozen
All alone I'll keep him cold to make sure that he stays
I am trying my very best
But now I face the hardest test
As I've no festive cheer

Yeah at Christmas I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me evergreen

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

[Verse 2]
Oh I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby all I want for Christmas is you
You baby

[Bridge]
Oh all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah oh oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
You baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you baby (Ah oh ah oh)
All I want for Christmas is you baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you baby (All I really want baby ooh)
All I want for Christmas is you baby (All I want all I really want is you)

Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say Hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh ho the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

[Instrumental]

Oh ho the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly

[Verse 1]
You shake me up and turn me upside down
Just like a snow globe
And every time you touch me
I shiver right down to my toes
You got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so

[Chorus]
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

[Verse 2]
Outside it's coming down
But here inside it's warming up so
When you take your time
You turn me on and make my life glow
You got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so

[Chorus]
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 1]
Tonight I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday
Alone to celebrate

[Pre-Chorus]
But then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be

Underneath the tree

[Verse 2]
I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be

[Verse 1]
Every year around this time I start to think about you
We're really gonna have another Christmas Eve without you
I can't believe it's been so long
Everyday finds a way to make me think about you
Like today when we were picking out the tree without you
I can't believe it's been so long

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh we miss you like hell all the stories that you'd tell
'Bout the boat that you built but never got to sail
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here we would

[Chorus]
Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here

[Verse 2]
Another year has passed and now it's time for buying the presents
I even got you one forgetting you're not gonna get it
I can't believe it's been so long
This time around we'll try to smile 'cause we're sick of tears
Most days are easy now but it gets hard this time of year
I can't believe you're really gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh we miss you like hell all the stories that you'd tell
'Bout the boat that you built but never got to sail
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here we would

[Chorus]
Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still
Wild and free I've got so many memories
Soon time too will take it all of 'em from me
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
When it's dark and it's cold everyone is coming home
I just wish you could know that's when we're missin' you the most
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here we would

[Chorus]
Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still
Wild and free I've got so many memories
Soon time too will take it all of 'em from me
Gone don't always mean that you disappear

[Verse 1: Kelly Clarkson & John Legend]
I really can't stay (Baby it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But I can call you a ride)
This evening has been (I'm so glad that you dropped in)
So very nice (Time spent with you is paradise)
My momma will start to worry (I'll call the car and tell him to hurry)
My daddy will be pacing the floor (Wait what are you still livin' home for?)
So really I'd better scurry (Your driver his name is Murray)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Oh we're both adults so who's keepin' score?)
What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice)
If I have one more drink? (It's your body and your choice)
Ooh you really know how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To cast a spell (One look at you and then I fell)
I ought to say ""No no no sir"" (Then you really ought to go go go)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (Well Murray he just pulled up outside)

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson John Legend & Both]
Oh I really can't stay
(I understand baby)
Baby it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson & John Legend]
I simply should go (Text me when you get home)
Oh I'm supposed to say no (Mm I guess that's respectable)
This welcome has been (I've been lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (But you better go before it storms)
My sister will be suspicious (Well gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Oh he loves my music baby I'm sure)
My gossipy neighbor is vicious (I'm a genie tell me what your wish is)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Oh that's somethin' we should probably explore)
I've got to get home (Oh baby I'm well aware)
Say lend me a coat (Oh keep it girl I don't care)
You've really been grand (I feel it when you touch my hands)
But don't you see? (I want you to stay it's not up to me)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Well they can talk but what do they know?)
At least there will be plenty implied (Oh let them mind their business and go-)
Uh ma'am I really can't stay

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson & Both]
Baby just go
It's cold baby
It's cold baby
But ooh I don't wanna go
It's cold outside

[Verse 1]
Tell me where did we go wrong?
We should be singing Christmas songs
Instead of shouting all night long like we do
We keep fighting in the street
When we should be home wrapped in the sheets
Putting presents underneath the tree for me and you

[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby yeah

[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh baby baby Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby baby Merry Christmas (To you)

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me ""I love you""

[Outro]
Oh baby baby Merry Christmas
Oh baby baby Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh baby baby Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh baby baby Merry Christmas
Oh baby baby Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)

I love you

Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days may your days may your days
Be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas' be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days may your days may your days
Be merry and bright
May all your Christmas' be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas' be white

[Verse 1]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said ""Winter love is spreading everywhere""
Summer came and took off with the Spring
So now we start the Christmas caroling
I'll find my way back home
And light up every tree
We will hang our stockings for you and one for me
Cause Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said ""Pack your bags and tell them you'll be there""

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise I promise I'll be home
Home I'll be home
(I'll be home)

[Verse 2]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said ""Wrap the gifts with all your love and care""
The wind it blows the snow up in the sky
But I won't let the wind delay my flight

I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise I promise I'll be home
I'll be home I'll be home

To the one I've been missing
To the one I've been missing

[Verse 1: Jade Thirlwall]
I'm sorry I ain't been around
But you've been on my mind a million times
I'll make it up to you now
We'll wrap the presents
And put up the tree together
Be together
Baby there's no better gift
And now that I have you here
That's when I feel it the most

[Chorus: Leigh-Anne Pinnock with Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirlwall]
'Cause I've been gone so long
But I kept holding on
'Cause I need to show you
Just how much I love you this Christmas
Is it the lights in your eyes?
They never shone so bright
I've waited all year to be near
To the one I've been missing
This Christmas

[Post-Chorus: All & Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
(You're the one I've been missing) (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

I've felt too lonely to sleep
Boy when you're on the wrong side of the world
Now with the snow at our feet (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
We'll sit by the fire
And we'll set the scene together
Dream together
Baby there's no better gift (Ooh-ooh-ahh)
Now that I have you here (Have you here)
That's when I feel it the most

Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""yoo hoo""
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Altogether

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

[Verse 1: Scott]
I’ve heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music do you?
Well it goes like this
The fourth the fifth the minor fall the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

[Verse 2: Avi]
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

[Verse 3: Kirstin]
Well baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a vict'ry march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

[Verse 4: Mitch]
Well maybe there’s a God above
But all I’ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it’s not a cry that you hear at night
It’s not somebody who's seen the light
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

I stopped believing in Santa when you said ""Goodbye love""
Was watching the snow fall
When you called to say we were through
Now whenever I hear those Christmas songs I just cry loud
So no I'm not giving your presents to somebody new
'Cause there's no mistletoe I kicked down the tree
'Cause right now that don't mean nothing to me
Why can't December just be over real real soon?
Because Christmas isn't Christmas without you

I stopped believing in Santa when you said ""Goodbye love""
I can fake it but they said good Saint Nick is honest to me
No lying I swear I've been so good all year what the fuck? (I'm not lying; swear)
So I thought I'd be getting everything that I need (Everything that I need)
Instead I got pain wrapped in heartbreak
No jingle bells no Santa's sleigh
Why can't December just be over real real soon? (Over real real soon)

Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 2]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

Five more nights on my own

Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go

And gone away (gone away) is the bluebird (is the bluebird)

He sings a love song
As we go along

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on (later on! ) we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire babe

I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Oh mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
But baby don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no no no
Aw baby it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see no no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!

Sweetly swinging o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Shepherds why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
Say what may the tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?

Him Whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee

We waited all through the year
For the day to appear
When we could be together in harmony

You know the time will come
Peace on earth for everyone
And we can live forever in a world where we are free
Let it shine for you and me

There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday

To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

We're all as one tonight
Makes no difference if you're black or white
'cause we can sing together in harmony

I know it's not too late
The world would be a better place
If we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
Send a message loud and clear

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air - you know it's everywhere
There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas every day

To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air - you know it's everywhere
There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas every day

Please tell me Christmas will never go away

Tomorrow he's flying away away from me

I don't need another gift I just have one wish
This year can you...

Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow let it snow in California

Dear Santa what happened to the plan we had?
I checked the news and it said it'd be a sunny day

Won't you find a way?

There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world before I get too old
And don't remember it so let's December it
And reassemble it oh yeah

Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness
Come on y'all it's Christmas time

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness
Come on y'all it's Christmas time

Ho ho ho ho ho ho
It's Christmas time

At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above

Can you send some happiness
With my best to the rest of the people
Of the east and the west?
And maybe every once in a while
Give my grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season of smile

It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
Let me meet a boy one day
That wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness
Come on y'all it's Christmas time

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness
Come on y'all it's Christmas time

I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been

I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow
When they believe again

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness
Come on y'all it's Christmas time

Shake it up shake up the happiness

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the night shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
A song a song high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace warm mighty king
Do you know what I know
A child a child shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say
A child a child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light

Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Deck the halls with boughs of holly

There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world
Before I get too old
And don't remember it
So let's december it
And reassemble it (oh yeah)
Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To feel the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list
Shake it up

A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say
I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness?
With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Get my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can know some happiness with me
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness

This love will grow in
Than to live again

How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Let it snow let it snow let it snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that'll make them ring is the carol that you'll sing
Right within your heart

[Chorus 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
And the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Tears we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm

Winter's on the wind
Sings familiar melodies
Chill starts setting in
Silver bells are casting spells
It all comes back again
Lay your troubles down
Let me hold you

Now all the signs appear
The Christmas trees the memories
They bring this time of year
Ghosts of winters past
Come in and whisper in your ear
Don't listen to a word they've told you

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm
Start a fire and feel it glow
As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
You don't have to face the cold alone no more
I'll keep you warm

It's only you and me
The world outside is frozen white
I know it's hard to see
I'll be your candle
Be your light
Be anything you need
Star above the night to guide you

To find the highest bow
Hang up your regrets and
Let them fade into the sound
The angel choirs and roaring fires
Magic lost and found
Love is all around
Let it find you

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm
Start a fire and feel it glow
As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
You don't have to face the cold alone no more
I'll keep you warm

Through the frightful weather
I will hold you tight
We'll stay warm together
This December night
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm

As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
Now I know you've faced the cold alone before
But you don't have to face the cold alone no more
Because I'll keep you warm...

Classical Christmas,Anonymous,Ding Dong! Merrily on High,https://open.spotify.com/track/5deugvvBm2rJBPI2S0BZmQ,0.318,0.253,-20.4,0.385,80.903,"

The poem of which the following pages offer a prose rendering is contained in a MS. believed to be unique of the Cottonian Collection Nero A.X. preserved in the British Museum. The MS. is of the end of the fourteenth century but it is possible that the composition of the poem is somewhat earlier; the subject-matter is certainly of very old date. There has been a considerable divergence of opinion among scholars on the question of authorship but the view now generally accepted is that it is the work of the same hand as Pearl another poem of considerable merit contained in the same MS.
Our poem or to speak more correctly metrical romance contains over 2500 lines and is composed in staves of varying length ending in five short rhyming lines technically known as a bob and a wheel–the lines forming the body of the stave being not rhyming but alliterative. The dialect in which it is written has been decided to be West Midland probably Lancashire and is by no means easy to understand. Indeed it is the real difficulty and obscurity of the language which in spite of careful and scholarly editing will always place the poem in its original form outside the range of any but professed students of mediæval literature which has encouraged me to make an attempt to render it more accessible to the general public by giving it a form that shall be easily intelligible and at the same time preserve as closely as possible the style of the author.
For that style in spite of a certain roughness unavoidable at a period in which the language was still in a partially developed and amorphous stage is really charming. The author has a keen eye for effect; a talent for description detailed without becoming wearisome; a genuine love of Nature and sympathy with her varying moods; and a real refinement and elevation of feeling which enable him to deal with a risqué: situation with an absence of coarseness not unfortunately to be always met with in a mediæval writer. Standards of taste vary with the age but even judged by that of our own day the author of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight comes not all too badly out of the ordeal!
The story with which the poem deals too has claims upon our interest. I have shown elsewhere 1 that the beheading challenge is an incident of very early occurrence in heroic legend and that the particular form given to it in the English poem is especially interesting corresponding as it does to the variations of the story as preserved in the oldest known version that of the old Irish Fled Bricrend.
But in no other version is the incident coupled with that of a temptation and testing of the hero's honour and chastity such as meets us here. At first sight one is inclined to assign the episode of the lady of the castle to the class of stories of which the oldest version is preserved in Biblical record–the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife; a motif not unseldom employed by mediæval writers and which notably occurs in what we may call the Launfal group of stories. But there are certain points which may make us hesitate as to whether in its first conception the tale was really one of this class.
It must be noted that here the lady is acting throughout with the knowledge and consent of the husband an important point of difference. In the second place it is very doubtful whether her entire attitude was not a ruse. From the Green Knight's words to Gawain when he finally reveals himself ""I wot we shall soon make peace with my wife who was thy bitter enemy"" her conduct hardly seems to have been prompted by real passion.
In my Studies on the Legend of Sir Gawain already referred to I have suggested that the character of the lady here is perhaps a reminiscence of that of the Queen of the Magic Castle or Isle daughter or niece of an enchanter who at an early stage of Gawain's story was undoubtedly his love. I think it not impossible that she was an integral part of the tale as first told and her rôle here was determined by that which she originally played. In most versions of the story she has dropped out altogether. It is of course possible that there being but a confused reminiscence of the original tale her share may have been modified by the influence of the Launfal group; but I should prefer to explain the episode on the whole as a somewhat distorted survival of an original feature.
But in any case we may be thankful for this that the author of the most important English metrical romance dealing with Arthurian legend faithfully adheres to the original conception of Gawain's character as drawn before the monkish lovers of edification laid their ruthless hands on his legend and turned the model of knightly virtues and courtesy into a mere vulgar libertine.
Brave chivalrous loyally faithful to his plighted word scrupulously heedful of his own and others' honour Gawain stands before us in this poem. We take up Malory or Tennyson and in spite of their charm of style in spite of the halo of religious mysticism in which they have striven to enwrap their characters we lay them down with a feeling of dissatisfaction. How did the Gawain of their imagination this empty-headed empty-hearted worldling cruel murderer and treacherous friend ever come to be the typical English hero? For such Gawain certainly was even more than Arthur himself. Then we turn back to these faded pages and read the quaintly earnest words in which the old writer reveals the hidden meaning of that mystic symbol the pentangle and vindicates Gawain's title to claim it as his badge–and we smile perhaps but we cease to wonder at the widespread popularity of King Arthur's famous nephew or at the immense body of romance that claims him as its hero.
Scholars know all this of course; they can read the poem for themselves in its original rough and intricate phraseology; perhaps they will be shocked at an attempt to handle it in simpler form. But this little book is not for them and if to those to whom the tale would otherwise be a sealed treasure these pages bring some new knowledge of the way in which our forefathers looked on the characters of the Arthurian legend the tales they told of them (unconsciously betraying the while how they themselves lived and thought and spoke)–if by that means they gain a keener appreciation of our national heroes a wider knowledge of our national literature–then the spirit of the long-dead poet will doubtless not be the slowest to pardon my handling of what was his masterpiece as it is in M. Gaston Paris' words ""The jewel of English mediæval literature.""

Preface to Second Edition

In preparing this Second Edition I have adopted certain suggestions of the late Professor Kölbing contained in a review published by him in Englische Studien xxvi. In one or two instances however I have not felt free to follow his reading–e.g. on page 67 in þrynne syþe must certainly mean ""for the third time"" not ""thrice."" The lady has already kissed Gawain twice during the interview; Professor Kölbing's suggestion would make him receive five kisses instead of three the correct number. Nor do I think the story would gain anything by reproducing the details of the dissection of animals on page 46. This little series is not intended for scholars who can study the original works for themselves but for the general public and I have therefore avoided any digression from the main thread of the story. In the main however I have gladly availed myself of the late Professor's learned criticisms.
BOURNEMOUTH May 1900.


Sir Gawain and the Green Knight
After the siege and the assault of Troy when that burg was destroyed and burnt to ashes and the traitor tried for his treason the noble Æneas and his kin sailed forth to become princes and patrons of well-nigh all the Western Isles. Thus Romulus built Rome (and gave to the city his own name which it bears even to this day); and Ticius turned him to Tuscany; and Langobard raised him up dwellings in Lombardy; and Felix Brutus sailed far over the French flood and founded the kingdom of Britain wherein have been war and waste and wonder and bliss and bale ofttimes since.
And in that kingdom of Britain have been wrought more gallant deeds than in any other; but of all British kings Arthur was the most valiant as I have heard tell therefore will I set forth a wondrous adventure that fell out in his time. And if ye will listen to me but for a little while I will tell it even as it stands in story stiff and strong fixed in the letter as it hath long been known in the land.
*****
King Arthur lay at Camelot upon a Christmas-tide with many a gallant lord and lovely lady and all the noble brotherhood of the Round Table. There they held rich revels with gay talk and jest; one while they would ride forth to joust and tourney and again back to the court to make carols; 2 for there was the feast holden fifteen days with all the mirth that men could devise song and glee glorious to hear in the daytime and dancing at night. Halls and chambers were crowded with noble guests the bravest of knights and the loveliest of ladies and Arthur himself was the comeliest king that ever held a court. For all this fair folk were in their youth the fairest and most fortunate under heaven and the king himself of such fame that it were hard now to name so valiant a hero.
Now the New Year had but newly come in and on that day a double portion was served on the high table to all the noble guests and thither came the king with all his knights when the service in the chapel had been sung to an end. And they greeted each other for the New Year and gave rich gifts the one to the other (and they that received them were not wroth that may ye well believe!) and the maidens laughed and made mirth till it was time to get them to meat. Then they washed and sat them down to the feast in fitting rank and order and Guinevere the queen gaily clad sat on the high daïs. Silken was her seat with a fair canopy over her head of rich tapestries of Tars embroidered and studded with costly gems; fair she was to look upon with her shining grey eyes a fairer woman might no man boast himself of having seen.
But Arthur would not eat till all were served so full of joy and gladness was he even as a child; he liked not either to lie long or to sit long at meat so worked upon him his young blood and his wild brain. And another custom he had also that came of his nobility that he would never eat upon an high day till he had been advised of some knightly deed or some strange and marvellous tale of his ancestors or of arms or of other ventures. Or till some stranger knight should seek of him leave to joust with one of the Round Table that they might set their lives in jeopardy one against another as fortune might favour them. Such was the king's custom when he sat in hall at each high feast with his noble knights therefore on that New Year tide he abode fair of face on the throne and made much mirth withal.
Thus the king sat before the high tables and spake of many things; and there good Sir Gawain was seated by Guinevere the queen and on her other side sat Agravain à la dure main; 3 both were the king's sister's sons and full gallant knights. And at the end of the table was Bishop Bawdewyn and Ywain King Urien's son sat at the other side alone. These were worthily served on the daïs and at the lower tables sat many valiant knights. Then they bare the first course with the blast of trumpets and waving of banners with the sound of drums and pipes of song and lute that many a heart was uplifted at the melody. Many were the dainties and rare the meats so great was the plenty they might scarce find room on the board to set on the dishes. Each helped himself as he liked best and to each two were twelve dishes with great plenty of beer and wine.
Now I will say no more of the service but that ye may know there was no lack for there drew near a venture that the folk might well have left their labour to gaze upon. As the sound of the music ceased and the first course had been fitly served there came in at the hall door one terrible to behold of stature greater than any on earth; from neck to loin so strong and thickly made and with limbs so long and so great that he seemed even as a giant. And yet he was but a man only the mightiest that might mount a steed; broad of chest and shoulders and slender of waist and all his features of like fashion; but men marvelled much at his colour for he rode even as a knight yet was green all over.
For he was clad all in green with a straight coat and a mantle above; all decked and lined with fur was the cloth and the hood that was thrown back from his locks and lay on his shoulders. Hose had he of the same green and spurs of bright gold with silken fastenings richly worked; and all his vesture was verily green. Around his waist and his saddle were bands with fair stones set upon silken work 'twere too long to tell of all the trifles that were embroidered thereon–birds and insects in gay gauds of green and gold. All the trappings of his steed were of metal of like enamel even the stirrups that he stood in stained of the same and stirrups and saddle-bow alike gleamed and shone with green stones. Even the steed on which he rode was of the same hue a green horse great and strong and hard to hold with broidered bridle meet for the rider.
The knight was thus gaily dressed in green his hair falling around his shoulders; on his breast hung a beard as thick and green as a bush and the beard and the hair of his head were clipped all round above his elbows. The lower part of his sleeves were fastened with clasps in the same wise as a king's mantle. The horse's mane was crisp and plaited with many a knot folded in with gold thread about the fair green here a twist of the hair here another of gold. The tail was twined in like manner and both were bound about with a band of bright green set with many a precious stone; then they were tied aloft in a cunning knot whereon rang many bells of burnished gold. Such a steed might no other ride nor had such ever been looked upon in that hall ere that time; and all who saw that knight spake and said that a man might scarce abide his stroke.
The knight bore no helm nor hauberk neither gorget nor breast-plate neither shaft nor buckler to smite nor to shield but in one hand he had a holly-bough that is greenest when the groves are bare and in his other an axe huge and uncomely a cruel weapon in fashion if one would picture it. The head was an ell-yard long the metal all of green steel and gold the blade burnished bright with a broad edge as well shapen to shear as a sharp razor. The steel was set into a strong staff all bound round with iron even to the end and engraved with green in cunning work. A lace was twined about it that looped at the head and all adown the handle it was clasped with tassels on buttons of bright green richly broidered.
The knight rideth through the entrance of the hall driving straight to the high daïs and greeted no man but looked ever upwards; and the first words he spake were ""Where is the ruler of this folk? I would gladly look upon that hero and have speech with him."" He cast his eyes on the knights and mustered them up and down striving ever to see who of them was of most renown.
Then was there great gazing to behold that chief for each man marvelled what it might mean that a knight and his steed should have even such a hue as the green grass; and that seemed even greener than green enamel on bright gold. All looked on him as he stood and drew near unto him wondering greatly what he might be; for many marvels had they seen but none such as this and phantasm and faërie did the folk deem it. Therefore were the gallant knights slow to answer and gazed astounded and sat stone still in a deep silence through that goodly hall as if a slumber were fallen upon them. I deem it was not all for doubt but some for courtesy that they might give ear unto his errand.
Then Arthur beheld this adventurer before his high daïs and knightly he greeted him for fearful was he never. ""Sir"" he said ""thou art welcome to this place–lord of this hall am I and men call me Arthur. Light thee down and tarry awhile and what thy will is that shall we learn after.""
""Nay"" quoth the stranger ""so help me He that sitteth on high 'twas not mine errand to tarry any while in this dwelling; but the praise of this thy folk and thy city is lifted up on high and thy warriors are holden for the best and the most valiant of those who ride mail-clad to the fight. The wisest and the worthiest of this world are they and well proven in all knightly sports. And here as I have heard tell is fairest courtesy therefore have I come hither as at this time. Ye may be sure by the branch that I bear here that I come in peace seeking no strife. For had I willed to journey in warlike guise I have at home both hauberk and helm shield and shining spear and other weapons to mine hand but since I seek no war my raiment is that of peace. But if thou be as bold as all men tell thou wilt freely grant me the boon I ask.""
And Arthur answered ""Sir Knight if thou cravest battle here thou shalt not fail for lack of a foe.""
And the knight answered ""Nay I ask no fight in faith here on the benches are but beardless children were I clad in armour on my steed there is no man here might match me. Therefore I ask in this court but a Christmas jest for that it is Yule-tide and New Year and there are here many fain for sport. If any one in this hall holds himself so hardy 4 so bold both of blood and brain as to dare strike me one stroke for another I will give him as a gift this axe which is heavy enough in sooth to handle as he may list and I will abide the first blow unarmed as I sit. If any knight be so bold as to prove my words let him come swiftly to me here and take this weapon I quit claim to it he may keep it as his own and I will abide his stroke firm on the floor. Then shalt thou give me the right to deal him another the respite of a year and a day shall he have. Now haste and let see whether any here dare say aught.""
Now if the knights had been astounded at the first yet stiller were they all high and low when they had heard his words. The knight on his steed straightened himself in the saddle and rolled his eyes fiercely round the hall red they gleamed under his green and bushy brows. He frowned and twisted his beard waiting to see who should rise and when none answered he cried aloud in mockery ""What is this Arthur's hall and these the knights whose renown hath run through many realms? Where are now your pride and your conquests your wrath and anger and mighty words? Now are the praise and the renown of the Round Table overthrown by one man's speech since all keep silence for dread ere ever they have seen a blow!""
With that he laughed so loudly that the blood rushed to the king's fair face for very shame; he waxed wroth as did all his knights and sprang to his feet and drew near to the stranger and said ""Now by heaven foolish is thy asking and thy folly shall find its fitting answer. I know no man aghast at thy great words. Give me here thine axe and I shall grant thee the boon thou hast asked."" Lightly he sprang to him and caught at his hand and the knight fierce of aspect lighted down from his charger.
Then Arthur took the axe and gripped the haft and swung it round ready to strike. And the knight stood before him taller by the head than any in the hall; he stood and stroked his beard and drew down his coat no more dismayed for the king's threats than if one had brought him a drink of wine.
Then Gawain who sat by the queen leaned forward to the king and spake ""I beseech ye my lord let this venture be mine. Would ye but bid me rise from this seat and stand by your side so that my liege lady thought it not ill then would I come to your counsel before this goodly court. For I think it not seemly when such challenges be made in your hall that ye yourself should undertake it while there are many bold knights who sit beside ye none are there methinks of readier will under heaven or more valiant in open field. I am the weakest I wot and the feeblest of wit and it will be the less loss of my life if ye seek sooth. For save that ye are mine uncle naught is there in me to praise no virtue is there in my body save your blood and since this challenge is such folly that it beseems ye not to take it and I have asked it from ye first let it fall to me and if I bear myself ungallantly then let all this court blame me.""
Then they all spake with one voice that the king should leave this venture and grant it to Gawain.
Then Arthur commanded the knight to rise and he rose up quickly and knelt down before the king and caught hold of the weapon; and the king loosed his hold of it and lifted up his hand and gave him his blessing and bade him be strong both of heart and hand. ""Keep thee well nephew"" quoth Arthur ""that thou give him but the one blow and if thou redest him rightly I trow thou shalt well abide the stroke he may give thee after.""
Gawain stepped to the stranger axe in hand and he never fearing awaited his coming. Then the Green Knight spake to Sir Gawain ""Make we our covenant ere we go further. First I ask thee knight what is thy name? Tell me truly that I may know thee.""
""In faith"" quoth the good knight ""Gawain am I who give thee this buffet let what may come of it; and at this time twelvemonth will I take another at thine hand with whatsoever weapon thou wilt and none other.""
Then the other answered again ""Sir Gawain so may I thrive as I am fain to take this buffet at thine hand"" and he quoth further ""Sir Gawain it liketh me well that I shall take at thy fist that which I have asked here and thou hast readily and truly rehearsed all the covenant that I asked of the king save that thou shalt swear me by thy troth to seek me thyself wherever thou hopest that I may be found and win thee such reward as thou dealest me to-day before this folk.""
""Where shall I seek thee?"" quoth Gawain. ""Where is thy place? By Him that made me I wot never where thou dwellest nor know I thee knight thy court nor thy name. But teach me truly all that pertaineth thereto and tell me thy name and I shall use all my wit to win my way thither and that I swear thee for sooth and by my sure troth.""
""That is enough in the New Year it needs no more"" quoth the Green Knight to the gallant Gawain ""if I tell thee truly when I have taken the blow and thou hast smitten me; then will I teach thee of my house and home and mine own name then mayest thou ask thy road and keep covenant. And if I waste no words then farest thou the better for thou canst dwell in thy land and seek no further. But take now thy toll and let see how thy strikest.""
""Gladly will I"" quoth Gawain handling his axe.
Then the Green Knight swiftly made him ready he bowed down his head and laid his long locks on the crown that his bare neck might be seen. Gawain gripped his axe and raised it on high the left foot he set forward on the floor and let the blow fall lightly on the bare neck. The sharp edge of the blade sundered the bones smote through the neck and clave it in two so that the edge of the steel bit on the ground and the fair head fell to the earth that many struck it with their feet as it rolled forth. The blood spurted forth and glistened on the green raiment but the knight neither faltered nor fell; he started forward with out-stretched hand and caught the head and lifted it up; then he turned to his steed and took hold of the bride set his foot in the stirrup and mounted. His head he held by the hair in his hand. Then he seated himself in his saddle as if naught ailed him and he were not headless. He turned his steed about the grim corpse bleeding freely the while and they who looked upon him doubted them much for the covenant.
For he held up the head in his hand and turned the face towards them that sat on the high daïs and it lifted up the eyelids and looked upon them and spake as ye shall hear. ""Look Gawain that thou art ready to go as thou hast promised and seek leally till thou find me even as thou hast sworn in this hall in the hearing of these knights. Come thou I charge thee to the Green Chapel such a stroke as thou hast dealt thou hast deserved and it shall be promptly paid thee on New Year's morn. Many men know me as the knight of the Green Chapel and if thou askest thou shalt not fail to find me. Therefore it behoves thee to come or to yield thee as recreant.""
With that he turned his bridle and galloped out at the hall door his head in his hands so that the sparks flew from beneath his horse's hoofs. Whither he went none knew no more than they wist whence he had come; and the king and Gawain they gazed and laughed for in sooth this had proved a greater marvel than any they had known aforetime.
Though Arthur the king was astonished at his heart yet he let no sign of it be seen but spake in courteous wise to the fair queen: ""Dear lady be not dismayed such craft is well suited to Christmas-tide when we seek jesting laughter and song and fair carols of knights and ladies. But now I may well get me to meat for I have seen a marvel I may not forget."" Then he looked on Sir Gawain and said gaily ""Now fair nephew hang up thine axe since it has hewn enough"" and they hung it on the dossal above the daïs where all men might look on it for a marvel and by its true token tell of the wonder. Then the twain sat them down together the king and the good knight and men served them with a double portion as was the share of the noblest with all manner of meat and of minstrelsy. And they spent that day in gladness but Sir Gawain must well bethink him of the heavy venture to which he had set his hand. *****
This beginning of adventures had Arthur at the New Year; for he yearned to hear gallant tales though his words were few when he sat at the feast. But now had they stern work on hand. Gawain was glad to begin the jest in the hall but ye need have no marvel if the end be heavy. For though a man be merry in mind when he has well drunk yet a year runs full swiftly and the beginning but rarely matches the end.
For Yule was now over-past5 and the year after each season in its turn following the other. For after Christmas comes crabbed Lent that will have fish for flesh and simpler cheer. But then the weather of the world chides with winter; the cold withdraws itself the clouds uplift and the rain falls in warm showers on the fair plains. Then the flowers come forth meadows and grove are clad in green the birds make ready to build and sing sweetly for solace of the soft summer that follows thereafter. The blossoms bud and blow in the hedgerows rich and rank and noble notes enough are heard in the fair woods.
After the season of summer with the soft winds when zephyr breathes lightly on seeds and herbs joyous indeed is the growth that waxes thereout when the dew drips from the leaves beneath the blissful glance of the bright sun. But then comes harvest and hardens the grain warning it to wax ripe ere the winter. The drought drives the dust on high flying over the face of the land; the angry wind of the welkin wrestles with the sun; the leaves fall from the trees and light upon the ground and all brown are the groves that but now were green and ripe is the fruit that once was flower. So the year passes into many yesterdays and winter comes again as it needs no sage to tell us.
When the Michaelmas moon was come in with warnings of winter Sir Gawain bethought him full oft of his perilous journey. Yet till All Hallows Day he lingered with Arthur and on that day they made a great feast for the hero's sake with much revel and richness of the Round Table. Courteous knights and comely ladies all were in sorrow for the love of that knight and though they spake no word of it many were joyless for his sake.
And after meat sadly Sir Gawain turned to his uncle and spake of his journey and said ""Liege lord of my life leave from you I crave. Ye know well how the matter stands without more words to-morrow am I bound to set forth in search of the Green Knight.""
Then came together all the noblest knights Ywain and Erec and many another. Sir Dodinel le Sauvage the Duke of Clarence Launcelot and Lionel and Lucan the Good Sir Bors and Sir Bedivere valiant knights both and many another hero with Sir Mador de la Porte and they all drew near heavy at heart to take counsel with Sir Gawain. Much sorrow and weeping was there in the hall to think that so worthy a knight as Gawain should wend his way to seek a deadly blow and should no more wield his sword in fight. But the knight made ever good cheer and said ""Nay wherefore should I shrink? What may a man do but prove his fate?""
He dwelt there all that day and on the morn he arose and asked betimes for his armour; and they brought it unto him on this wise: first a rich carpet was stretched on the floor6 (and brightly did the gold gear glitter upon it) then the knight stepped on to it and handled the steel; clad he was in a doublet of silk with a close hood lined fairly throughout. Then they set the steel shoes upon his feet and wrapped his legs with greaves with polished knee-caps fastened with knots of gold. Then they cased his thighs in cuisses closed with thongs and brought him the byrny of bright steel rings sewn upon a fair stuff. Well burnished braces they set on each arm with good elbow-pieces and gloves of mail and all the goodly gear that should shield him in his need. And they cast over all a rich surcoat and set the golden spurs on his heels and girt him with a trusty sword fastened with a silken bawdrick. When he was thus clad his harness was costly for the least loop or latchet gleamed with gold. So armed as he was he hearkened Mass and made his offering at the high altar. Then he came to the king and the knights of his court and courteously took leave of lords and ladies and they kissed him and commended him to Christ.
With that was Gringalet ready girt with a saddle that gleamed gaily with many golden fringes enriched and decked anew for the venture. The bridle was all barred about with bright gold buttons and all the covertures and trappings of the steed the crupper and the rich skirts accorded with the saddle; spread fair with the rich red gold that glittered and gleamed in the rays of the sun.
Then the knight called for his helmet which was well lined throughout and set it high on his head and hasped it behind. He wore a light kerchief over the vintail that was broidered and studded with fair gems on a broad silken ribbon with birds of gay colour and many a turtle and true-lover's knot interlaced thickly even as many a maiden had wrought diligently for seven winter long. But the circlet which crowned his helmet was yet more precious being adorned with a device in diamonds. Then they brought him his shield which was of bright red with the pentangle painted thereon in gleaming gold.7 And why that noble prince bare the pentangle I am minded to tell you though my tale tarry thereby. It is a sign that Solomon set ere-while as betokening truth; for it is a figure with five points and each line overlaps the other and nowhere hath it beginning or end so that in English it is called ""the endless knot."" And therefore was it well suiting to this knight and to his arms since Gawain was faithful in five and five-fold for pure was he as gold void of all villainy and endowed with all virtues. Therefore he bare the pentangle on shield and surcoat as truest of heroes and gentlest of knights.
For first he was faultless in his five senses; and his five fingers never failed him; and all his trust upon earth was in the five wounds that Christ bare on the cross as the Creed tells. And wherever this knight found himself in stress of battle he deemed well that he drew his strength from the five joys which the Queen of Heaven had of her Child. And for this cause did he bear an image of Our Lady on the one half of his shield that whenever he looked upon it he might not lack for aid. And the fifth five that the hero used were frankness and fellowship above all purity and courtesy that never failed him and compassion that surpasses all; and in these five virtues was that hero wrapped and clothed. And all these five-fold were linked one in the other so that they had no end and were fixed on five points that never failed neither at any side were they joined or sundered nor could ye find beginning or end. And therefore on his shield was the knot shapen red-gold upon red which is the pure pentangle. Now was Sir Gawain ready and he took his lance in hand and bade them all Farewell he deemed it had been for ever.
Then he smote the steed with his spurs and sprang on his way so that sparks flew from the stones after him. All that saw him were grieved at heart and said one to the other ""By Christ 'tis great pity that one of such noble life should be lost! I'faith 'twere not easy to find his equal upon earth. The king had done better to have wrought more warily. Yonder knight should have been made a duke; a gallant leader of men is he and such a fate had beseemed him better than to be hewn in pieces at the will of an elfish man for mere pride. Who ever knew a king to take such counsel as to risk his knights on a Christmas jest?"" Many were the tears that flowed from their eyes when that goodly knight rode from the hall. He made no delaying but went his way swiftly and rode many a wild road as I heard say in the book.
So rode Sir Gawain through the realm of Logres on an errand that he held for no jest. Often he lay companionless at night and must lack the fare that he liked. No comrade had he save his steed and none save God with whom to take counsel. At length he drew nigh to North Wales and left the isles of Anglesey on his left hand crossing over the fords by the foreland over at Holyhead till he came into the wilderness of Wirral8 where but few dwell who love God and man of true heart. And ever he asked as he fared of all whom he met if they had heard any tidings of a Green Knight in the country thereabout or of a Green Chapel? And all answered him Nay never in their lives had they seen any man of such a hue. And the knight wended his way by many a strange road and many a rugged path and the fashion of his countenance changed full often ere he saw the Green Chapel.
Many a cliff did he climb in that unknown land where afar from his friends he rode as a stranger. Never did he come to a stream or a ford but he found a foe before him and that one so marvellous so foul and fell that it behoved him to fight. So many wonders did that knight behold that it were too long to tell the tenth part of them. Sometimes he fought with dragons and wolves; sometimes with wild men that dwelt in the rocks; another while with bulls and bears and wild boars or with giants of the high moorland that drew near to him. Had he not been a doughty knight enduring and of well-proved valour and a servant of God doubtless he had been slain for he was oft in danger of death. Yet he cared not so much for the strife what he deemed worse was when the cold clear water was shed from the clouds and froze ere it fell on the fallow ground. More nights than enough he slept in his harness on the bare rocks near slain with the sleet while the stream leapt bubbling from the crest of the hills and hung in hard icicles over his head.
Thus in peril and pain and many a hardship the knight rode alone till Christmas Eve and in that tide he made his prayer to the Blessed Virgin that she would guide his steps and lead him to some dwelling. On that morning he rode by a hill and came into a thick forest wild and drear; on each side were high hills and thick woods below them of great hoar oaks a hundred together of hazel and hawthorn with their trailing boughs intertwined and rough ragged moss spreading everywhere. On the bare twigs the birds chirped piteously for pain of the cold. The knight upon Gringalet rode lonely beneath them through marsh and mire much troubled at heart lest he should fail to see the service of the Lord who on that self-same night was born of a maiden for the cure of our grief; and therefore he said sighing ""I beseech Thee Lord and Mary Thy gentle Mother for some shelter where I may hear Mass and Thy mattins at morn. This I ask meekly and thereto I pray my Paternoster Ave and Credo."" Thus he rode praying and lamenting his misdeeds and he crossed himself and said ""May the Cross of Christ speed me.""
Now that knight had crossed himself but thrice ere he was aware in the wood of a dwelling within a moat above a lawn on a mound surrounded by many mighty trees that stood round the moat. 'Twas the fairest castle that ever a knight owned9; built in a meadow with a park all about it and a spiked palisade closely driven that enclosed the trees for more than two miles. The knight was ware of the hold from the side as it shone through the oaks. Then he lifted off his helmet and thanked Christ and S. Julian that they had courteously granted his prayer and hearkened to his cry. ""Now"" quoth the knight ""I beseech ye grant me fair hostel."" Then he pricked Gringalet with his golden spurs and rode gaily towards the great gate and came swiftly to the bridge end.
The bridge was drawn up and the gates close shut; the walls were strong and thick so that they might fear no tempest. The knight on his charger abode on the bank of the deep double ditch that surrounded the castle. The walls were set deep in the water and rose aloft to a wondrous height; they were of hard hewn stone up to the corbels which were adorned beneath the battlements with fair carvings and turrets set in between with many a loophole; a better barbican Sir Gawain had never looked upon. And within he beheld the high hall with its tower and many windows with carven cornices and chalk-white chimneys on the turreted roofs that shone fair in the sun. And everywhere thickly scattered on the castle battlements were pinnacles so many that it seemed as if it were all wrought out of paper so white was it.
The knight on his steed deemed it fair enough if he might come to be sheltered within it to lodge there while that the Holy-day lasted. He called aloud and soon there came a porter of kindly countenance who stood on the wall and greeted this knight and asked his errand.
""Good sir"" quoth Gawain ""wilt thou go mine errand to the high lord of the castle and crave for me lodging?""
""Yea by S. Peter"" quoth the porter. ""In sooth I trow that ye be welcome to dwell here so long as it may like ye.""
Then he went and came again swiftly and many folk with him to receive the knight. They let down the great drawbridge and came forth and knelt on their knees on the cold earth to give him worthy welcome. They held wide open the great gates and courteously he bid them rise and rode over the bridge. Then men came to him and held his stirrup while he dismounted and took and stabled his steed. There came down knights and squires to bring the guest with joy to the hall. When he raised his helmet there were many to take it from his hand fain to serve him and they took from him sword and shield.
Sir Gawain gave good greeting to the noble and the mighty men who came to do him honour. Clad in his shining armour they led him to the hall where a great fire burnt brightly on the floor; and the lord of the household came forth from his chamber to meet the hero fitly. He spake to the knight and said: ""Ye are welcome to do here as it likes ye. All that is here is your own to have at your will and disposal.""
""Gramercy!"" quote Gawain ""may Christ requite ye.""
As friends that were fain each embraced the other; and Gawain looked on the knight who greeted him so kindly and thought 'twas a bold warrior that owned that burg.
Of mighty stature he was and of high age; broad and flowing was his beard and of a bright hue. He was stalwart of limb and strong in his stride his face fiery red and his speech free: in sooth he seemed one well fitted to be a leader of valiant men.
Then the lord led Sir Gawain to a chamber and commanded folk to wait upon him and at his bidding there came men enough who brought the guest to a fair bower. The bedding was noble with curtains of pure silk wrought with gold and wondrous coverings of fair cloth all embroidered. The curtains ran on ropes with rings of red gold and the walls were hung with carpets of Orient and the same spread on the floor. There with mirthful speeches they took from the guest his byrny and all his shining armour and brought him rich robes of the choicest in its stead. They were long and flowing and became him well and when he was clad in them all who looked on the hero thought that surely God had never made a fairer knight: he seemed as if he might be a prince without peer in the field where men strive in battle.
Then before the hearth-place whereon the fire burned they made ready a chair for Gawain hung about with cloth and fair cushions; and there they cast around him a mantle of brown samite richly embroidered and furred within with costly skins of ermine with a hood of the same and he seated himself in that rich seat and warmed himself at the fire and was cheered at heart. And while he sat thus the serving men set up a table on trestles and covered it with a fair white cloth and set thereon salt-cellar and napkin and silver spoons; and the knight washed at his will and set him down to meat.
The folk served him courteously with many dishes seasoned of the best a double portion. All kinds of fish were there some baked in bread some broiled on the embers some sodden some stewed and savoured with spices with all sorts of cunning devices to his taste. And often he called it a feast when they spake gaily to him all together and said ""Now take ye this penance and it shall be for your amendment."" Much mirth thereof did Sir Gawain make.
Then they questioned that prince courteously of whence he came; and he told them that he was of the court of Arthur who is the rich royal King of the Round Table and that it was Gawain himself who was within their walls and would keep Christmas with them as the chance had fallen out. And when the lord of the castle heard those tidings he laughed aloud for gladness and all men in that keep were joyful that they should be in the company of him to whom belonged all fame and valour and courtesy and whose honour was praised above that of all men on earth. Each said softly to his fellow ""Now shall we see courteous bearing and the manner of speech befitting courts. What charm lieth in gentle speech shall we learn without asking since here we have welcomed the fine father of courtesy. God has surely shewn us His grace since He sends us such a guest as Gawain! When men shall sit and sing blithe for Christ's birth this knight shall bring us to the knowledge of fair manners and it may be that hearing him we may learn the cunning speech of love.""
By the time the knight had risen from dinner it was near nightfall. Then chaplains took their way to the chapel and rang loudly even as they should for the solemn evensong of the high feast. Thither went the lord and the lady also and entered with her maidens into a comely closet and thither also went Gawain. Then the lord took him by the sleeve and led him to a seat and called him by his name and told him he was of all men in the world the most welcome. And Sir Gawain thanked him truly and each kissed the other and they sat gravely together throughout the service.
Then was the lady fain to look upon that knight; and she came forth from her closet with many fair maidens. The fairest of ladies was she in face and figure and colouring fairer even than Guinevere so the knight thought. She came through the chancel to greet the hero another lady held her by the left hand older than she and seemingly of high estate with many nobles about her. But unlike to look upon were those ladies for if the younger were fair the elder was yellow. Rich red were the cheeks of the one rough and wrinkled those of the other; the kerchiefs of the one were broidered with many glistening pearls her throat and neck bare and whiter than the snow that lies on the hills; the neck of the other was swathed in a gorget with a white wimple over her black chin. Her forehead was wrapped in silk with many folds worked with knots so that naught of her was seen save her black brows her eyes her nose and her lips and those were bleared and ill to look upon. A worshipful lady in sooth one might call her! In figure was she short and broad and thickly made–far fairer to behold was she whom she led by the hand.
When Gawain beheld that fair lady who looked at him graciously with leave of the lord he went towards them and bowing low he greeted the elder but the younger and fairer he took lightly in his arms and kissed her courteously and greeted her in knightly wise. Then she hailed him as friend and he quickly prayed to be counted as her servant if she so willed. Then they took him between them and talking led him to the chamber to the hearth and bade them bring spices and they brought them in plenty with the good wine that was wont to be drunk at such seasons. Then the lord sprang to his feet and bade them make merry and took off his hood and hung it on a spear and bade him win the worship thereof who should make most mirth that Christmas-tide. ""And I shall try by my faith to fool it with the best by the help of my friends ere I lose my raiment."" Thus with gay words the lord made trial to gladden Gawain with jests that night till it was time to bid them light the tapers and Sir Gawain took leave of them and gat him to rest.
In the morn when all men call to mind how Christ our Lord was born on earth to die for us there is joy for His sake in all dwellings of the world; and so was there here on that day. For high feast was held with many dainties and cunningly cooked messes. On the daïs sat gallant men clad in their best. The ancient dame sat on the high seat with the lord of the castle beside her. Gawain and the fair lady sat together even in the midst of the board when the feast was served; and so throughout all the hall each sat in his degree and was served in order. There was meat there was mirth there was much joy so that to tell thereof would take me too long though peradventure I might strive to declare it. But Gawain and that fair lady had much joy of each other's company through her sweet words and courteous converse. And there was music made before each prince trumpets and drums and merry piping; each man hearkened his minstrel and they too hearkened theirs.
So they held high feast that day and the next and the third day thereafter and the joy on S. John's Day was fair to hearken for 'twas the last of the feast and the guests would depart in the grey of the morning. Therefore they awoke early and drank wine and danced fair carols and at last when it was late each man took his leave to wend early on his way. Gawain would bid his host farewell but the lord took him by the hand and led him to his own chamber beside the hearth and there he thanked him for the favour he had shown him in honouring his dwelling at that high season and gladdening his castle with his fair countenance. ""I wis sir that while I live I shall be held the worthier that Gawain has been my guest at God's own feast.""
""Gramercy sir"" quoth Gawain ""in good faith all the honour is yours may the High King give it you and I am but at your will to work your behest inasmuch as I am beholden to you in great and small by rights.""
Then the lord did his best to persuade the knight to tarry with him but Gawain answered that he might in no wise do so. Then the host asked him courteously what stern behest had driven him at the holy season from the king's court to fare all alone ere yet the feast was ended?
""Forsooth"" quoth the knight ""ye say but the truth: 'tis a high quest and a pressing that hath brought me afield for I am summoned myself to a certain place and I know not whither in the world I may wend to find it; so help me Christ I would give all the kingdom of Logres an I might find it by New Year's morn. Therefore sir I make request of you that ye tell me truly if ye ever heard word of the Green Chapel where it may be found and the Green Knight that keeps it. For I am pledged by solemn compact sworn between us to meet that knight at the New Year if so I were on life; and of that same New Year it wants but little–I'faith I would look on that hero more joyfully than on any other fair sight! Therefore by your will it behoves me to leave you for I have but barely three days and I would as fain fall dead as fail of mine errand.""
Then the lord quoth laughing ""Now must ye needs stay for I will show you your goal the Green Chapel ere your term be at an end have ye no fear! But ye can take your ease friend in your bed till the fourth day and go forth on the first of the year and come to that place at mid-morn to do as ye will. Dwell here till New Year's Day and then rise and set forth and ye shall be set in the way; 'tis not two miles hence.""
Then was Gawain glad and he laughed gaily. ""Now I thank you for this above all else. Now my quest is achieved I will dwell here at your will and otherwise do as ye shall ask.""
Then the lord took him and set him beside him and bade the ladies be fetched for their greater pleasure tho' between themselves they had solace. The lord for gladness made merry jest even as one who wist not what to do for joy; and he cried aloud to the knight ""Ye have promised to do the thing I bid ye: will ye hold to this behest here at once?""
""Yea forsooth"" said that true knight ""while I abide in your burg I am bound by your behest.""
""Ye have travelled from far"" said the host ""and since then ye have waked with me ye are not well refreshed by rest and sleep as I know. Ye shall therefore abide in your chamber and lie at your ease tomorrow at Mass-tide and go to meat when ye will with my wife who shall sit with you and comfort you with her company till I return; and I shall rise early and go forth to the chase."" And Gawain agreed to all this courteously.
""Sir knight"" quoth the host ""we shall make a covenant. Whatsoever I win in the wood shall be yours and whatever may fall to your share that shall ye exchange for it. Let us swear friend to make this exchange however our hap may be for worse or for better.""
""I grant ye your will"" quoth Gawain the good; ""if ye list so to do it liketh me well.""
""Bring hither the wine-cup the bargain is made"" so said the lord of that castle. They laughed each one and drank of the wine and made merry these lords and ladies as it pleased them. Then with gay talk and merry jest they arose and stood and spoke softly and kissed courteously and took leave of each other. With burning torches and many a serving-man was each led to his couch; yet ere they gat them to bed the old lord oft repeated their covenant for he knew well how to make sport. *****
Full early ere daylight the folk rose up; the guests who would depart called their grooms and they made them ready and saddled the steeds tightened up the girths and trussed up their mails. The knights all arrayed for riding leapt up lightly and took their bridles and each rode his way as pleased him best.
The lord of the land was not the last. Ready for the chase with many of his men he ate a sop hastily when he had heard Mass and then with blast of the bugle fared forth to the field.10 He and his nobles were to horse ere daylight glimmered upon the earth.
Then the huntsmen coupled their hounds unclosed the kennel door and called them out. They blew three blasts gaily on the bugles the hounds bayed fiercely and they that would go a-hunting checked and chastised them. A hundred hunters there were of the best so I have heard tell. Then the trackers gat them to the trysting-place and uncoupled the hounds and forest rang again with their gay blasts.
At the first sound of the hunt the game quaked for fear and fled trembling along the vale. They betook them to the heights but the liers in wait turned them back with loud cries; the harts they let pass them and the stags with their spreading antlers for the lord had forbidden that they should be slain but the hinds and the does they turned back and drave down into the valleys. Then might ye see much shooting of arrows. As the deer fled under the boughs a broad whistling shaft smote and wounded each sorely so that wounded and bleeding they fell dying on the banks. The hounds followed swiftly on their tracks and hunters blowing the horn sped after them with ringing shouts as if the cliffs burst asunder. What game escaped those that shot was run down at the outer ring. Thus were they driven on the hills and harassed at the waters so well did the men know their work and the greyhounds were so great and swift that they ran them down as fast as the hunters could slay them. Thus the lord passed the day in mirth and joyfulness even to nightfall.
So the lord roamed the woods and Gawain that good night lay ever a-bed curtained about under the costly coverlet while the daylight gleamed on the walls. And as he lay half slumbering he heard a little sound at the door and he raised his head and caught back a corner of the curtain and waited to see what it might be. It was the lovely lady the lord's wife; she shut the door softly behind her and turned towards the bed; and Gawain was shamed laid him down softly and made as if he slept. And she came lightly to the bedside within the curtain and sat herself down beside him to wait till he wakened. The knight lay there awhile and marvelled within himself what her coming might betoken; and he said to himself ""'Twere more seemly if I asked her what hath brought her hither."" Then he made feint to waken and turned towards her and opened his eyes as one astonished and crossed himself; and she looked on him laughing with her cheeks red and white lovely to behold and small smiling lips.
""Good morrow Sir Gawain"" said that fair lady; ""ye are but a careless sleeper since one can enter thus. Now are ye taken unawares and lest ye escape me I shall bind you in your bed; of that be ye assured!"" Laughing she spake these words.
""Good morrow fair lady"" quoth Gawain blithely. ""I will do your will as it likes me well. For I yield me readily and pray your grace and that is best by my faith since I needs must do so."" Thus he jested again laughing. ""But an ye would fair lady grant me this grace that ye pray your prisoner to rise. I would get me from bed and array me better then could I talk with ye in more comfort.""
""Nay forsooth fair sir"" quoth the lady ""ye shall not rise I will rede ye better. I shall keep ye here since ye can do no other and talk with my knight whom I have captured. For I know well that ye are Sir Gawain whom all the world worships wheresoever ye may ride. Your honour and your courtesy are praised by lords and ladies by all who live. Now ye are here and we are alone my lord and his men are afield; the serving men in their beds and my maidens also and the door shut upon us. And since in this hour I have him that all men love I shall use my time well with speech while it lasts. Ye are welcome to my company for it behoves me in sooth to be your servant.""
""In good faith"" quoth Gawain ""I think me that I am not him of whom ye speak for unworthy am I of such service as ye here proffer. In sooth I were glad if I might set myself by word or service to your pleasure; a pure joy would it be to me!""
""In good faith Sir Gawain"" quoth the gay lady ""the praise and the prowess that pleases all ladies I lack them not nor hold them light; yet are there ladies enough who would liever now have the knight in their hold as I have ye here to dally with your courteous words to bring them comfort and to ease their cares than much of the treasure and the gold that are theirs. And now through the grace of Him who upholds the heavens I have wholly in my power that which they all desire!""
Thus the lady fair to look upon made him great cheer and Sir Gawain with modest words answered her again: ""Madam"" he quoth ""may Mary requite ye for in good faith I have found in ye a noble frankness. Much courtesy have other folk shown me but the honour they have done me is naught to the worship of yourself who knoweth but good.""
""By Mary"" quoth the lady ""I think otherwise; for were I worth all the women alive and had I the wealth of the world in my hand and might choose me a lord to my liking then for all that I have seen in ye Sir Knight of beauty and courtesy and blithe semblance and for all that I have hearkened and hold for true there should be no knight on earth to be chosen before ye!""
""Well I wot"" quoth Sir Gawain ""that ye have chosen a better; but I am proud that ye should so prize me and as your servant do I hold ye my sovereign and your knight am I and may Christ reward ye.""
So they talked of many matters till mid-morn was past and ever the lady made as though she loved him and the knight turned her speech aside. For though she were the brightest of maidens yet had he forborne to shew her love for the danger that awaited him and the blow that must be given without delay.
Then the lady prayed her leave from him and he granted it readily. And she gave [the text reads ""have""] him good-day with laughing glance but he must needs marvel at her words:
""Now He that speeds fair speech reward ye this disport; but that ye be Gawain my mind misdoubts me greatly.""
""Wherefore?"" quoth the knight quickly fearing lest he had lacked in some courtesy.
And the lady spake: ""So true a knight as Gawain is holden and one so perfect in courtesy would never have tarried so long with a lady but he would of his courtesy have craved a kiss at parting.""
Then quoth Gawain ""I wot I will do even as it may please ye and kiss at your commandment as a true knight should who forbears to ask for fear of displeasure.""
At that she came near and bent down and kissed the knight and each commended the other to Christ and she went forth from the chamber softly.
Then Sir Gawain arose and called his chamberlain and chose his garments and when he was ready he gat him forth to Mass and then went to meat and made merry all day till the rising of the moon and never had a knight fairer lodging than had he with those two noble ladies the elder and the younger.
And even the lord of the land chased the hinds through holt and heath till eventide and then with much blowing of bugles and baying of hounds they bore the game homeward; and by the time daylight was done all the folk had returned to that fair castle. And when the lord and Sir Gawain met together then were they both well pleased. The lord commanded them all to assemble in the great hall and the ladies to descend with their maidens and there before them all he bade the men fetch in the spoil of the day's hunting and he called unto Gawain and counted the tale of the beasts and showed them unto him and said ""What think ye of this game Sir Knight? Have I deserved of ye thanks for my woodcraft?""
""Yea I wis"" quoth the other ""here is the fairest spoil I have seen this seven year in the winter season.""
""And all this do I give ye Gawain"" quoth the host ""for by accord of covenant ye may claim it as your own.""
""That is sooth"" quoth the other ""I grant you that same; and I have fairly won this within walls and with as good will do I yield it to ye."" With that he clasped his hands round the lord's neck and kissed him as courteously as he might. ""Take ye here my spoils no more have I won; ye should have it freely though it were greater than this.""
""'Tis good"" said the host ""gramercy thereof. Yet were I fain to know where ye won this same favour and if it were by your own wit?""
""Nay"" answered Gawain ""that was not in the bond. Ask me no more: ye have taken what was yours by right be content with that.""
They laughed and jested together and sat them down to supper where they were served with many dainties; and after supper they sat by the hearth and wine was served out to them; and oft in their jesting they promised to observe on the morrow the same covenant that they had made before and whatever chance might betide to exchange their spoil be it much or little when they met at night. Thus they renewed their bargain before the whole court and then the night-drink was served and each courteously took leave of the other and gat him to bed.
By the time the cock had crowed thrice the lord of the castle had left his bed; Mass was sung and meat fitly served. The folk were forth to the wood ere the day broke with hound and horn they rode over the plain and uncoupled their dogs among the thorns. Soon they struck on the scent and the hunt cheered on the hounds who were first to seize it urging them with shouts. The others hastened to the cry forty at once and there rose such a clamour from the pack that the rocks rang again. The huntsmen spurred them on with shouting and blasts of the horn; and the hounds drew together to a thicket betwixt the water and a high crag in the cliff beneath the hillside. There where the rough rock fell ruggedly they the huntsmen fared to the finding and cast about round the hill and the thicket behind them. The knights wist well what beast was within and would drive him forth with the bloodhounds. And as they beat the bushes suddenly over the beaters there rushed forth a wondrous great and fierce boar long since had he left the herd to roam by himself. Grunting he cast many to the ground and fled forth at his best speed without more mischief. The men hallooed loudly and cried ""Hay! Hay!"" and blew the horns to urge on the hounds and rode swiftly after the boar. Many a time did he turn to bay and tare the hounds and they yelped and howled shrilly. Then the men made ready their arrows and shot at him but the points were turned on his thick hide and the barbs would not bite upon him for the shafts shivered in pieces and the head but leapt again wherever it hit.
But when the boar felt the stroke of the arrows he waxed mad with rage and turned on the hunters and tare many so that affrightened they fled before him. But the lord on a swift steed pursued him blowing his bugle; as a gallant knight he rode through the woodland chasing the boar till the sun grew low.
So did the hunters this day while Sir Gawain lay in his bed lapped in rich gear; and the lady forgat not to salute him for early was she at his side to cheer his mood.
She came to the bedside and looked on the knight and Gawain gave her fit greeting and she greeted him again with ready words and sat her by his side and laughed and with a sweet look she spoke to him:
""Sir if ye be Gawain I think it a wonder that ye be so stern and cold and care not for the courtesies of friendship but if one teach ye to know them ye cast the lesson out of your mind. Ye have soon forgotten what I taught ye yesterday by all the truest tokens that I knew!""
""What is that?"" quoth the knight. ""I trow I know not. If it be sooth that ye say then is the blame mine own.""
""But I taught ye of kissing "" quoth the fair lady. ""Wherever a fair countenance is shown him it behoves a courteous knight quickly to claim a kiss.""
""Nay my dear"" said Sir Gawain ""cease that speech; that durst I not do lest I were denied for if I were forbidden I wot I were wrong did I further entreat.""
""I' faith"" quoth the lady merrily ""ye may not be forbid ye are strong enough to constrain by strength an ye will were any so discourteous as to give ye denial.""
""Yea by Heaven"" said Gawain ""ye speak well; but threats profit little in the land where I dwell and so with a gift that is given not of good will! I am at your commandment to kiss when ye like to take or to leave as ye list.""
Then the lady bent her down and kissed him courteously.
And as they spake together she said ""I would learn somewhat from ye an ye would not be wroth for young ye bare and fair and so courteous and knightly as ye are known to be the head of all chivalry and versed in all wisdom of love and war–'tis ever told of true knights how they adventured their lives for their true love and endured hardships for her favours and avenged her with valour and eased her sorrows and brought joy to her bower; and ye are the fairest knight of your time and your fame and your honour are everywhere yet I have sat by ye here twice and never a word have I heard of love! Ye who are so courteous and skilled in such love ought surely to teach one so young and unskilled some little craft of true love! Why are ye so unlearned who art otherwise so famous? Or is it that ye deemed me unworthy to hearken to your teaching? For shame Sir Knight! I come hither alone and sit at your side to learn of ye some skill; teach me of your wit while my lord is from home.""
""In good faith"" quoth Gawain ""great is my joy and my profit that so fair a lady as ye are should deign to come hither and trouble ye with so poor a man and make sport with your knight with kindly countenance it pleaseth me much. But that I in my turn should take it upon me to tell of love and such like matters to ye who know more by half or a hundred fold of such craft than I do or ever shall in all my lifetime by my troth 'twere folly indeed! I will work your will to the best of my might as I am bounden and evermore will I be your servant so help me Christ!""
Then often with guile she questioned that knight that she might win him to woo her but he defended himself so fairly that none might in any wise blame him and naught but bliss and harmless jesting was there between them. They laughed and talked together till at last she kissed him and craved her leave of him and went her way.
Then the knight arose and went forth to Mass and afterward dinner was served and he sat and spake with the ladies all day. But the lord of the castle rode ever over the land chasing the wild boar that fled through the thickets slaying the best of his hounds and breaking their backs in sunder; till at last he was so weary he might run no longer but made for a hole in a mound by a rock. He got the mound at his back and faced the hounds whetting his white tusks and foaming at the mouth. The huntsmen stood aloof fearing to draw nigh him; so many of them had been already wounded that they were loth to be torn with his tusks so fierce he was and mad with rage. At length the lord himself came up and saw the beast at bay and the men standing aloof. Then quickly he sprang to the ground and drew out a bright blade and waded through the stream to the boar.
When the beast was aware of the knight with weapon in hand he set up his bristles and snorted loudly and many feared for their lord lest he should be slain. Then the boar leapt upon the knight so that beast and man were one atop of the other in the water; but the boar had the worst of it for the man had marked even as he sprang and set the point of his brand to the beast's chest and drove it up to the hilt so that the heart was split in twain and the boar fell snarling and was swept down by the water to where a hundred hounds seized on him and the men drew him to shore for the dogs to slay.
Then was there loud blowing of horns and baying of hounds the huntsmen smote off the boar's head and hung the carcase by the four feet to a stout pole and so went on their way homewards. The head they bore before the lord himself who had slain the beast at the ford by force of his strong hand.
It seemed him o'er long ere he saw Sir Gawain in the hall and he called and the guest came to take that which fell to his share. And when he saw Gawain the lord laughed aloud and bade them call the ladies and the household together and he showed them the game and told them the tale how they hunted the wild boar through the woods and of his length and breadth and height; and Sir Gawain commended his deeds and praised him for his valour well proven for so mighty a beast had he never seen before.
Then they handled the huge head and the lord said aloud ""Now Gawain this game is your own by sure covenant as ye right well know.""
""'Tis sooth"" quoth the knight ""and as truly will I give ye all I have gained."" He took the host round the neck and kissed him courteously twice. ""Now are we quits"" he said ""this eventide of all the covenants that we made since I came hither.""
And the lord answered ""By S. Giles ye are the best I know; ye will be rich in a short space if ye drive such bargains!""
Then they set up the tables on trestles and covered them with fair cloths and lit waxen tapers on the walls. The knights sat and were served in the hall and much game and glee was there round the hearth with many songs both at supper and after; song of Christmas and new carols with all the mirth one may think of. And ever that lovely lady sat by the knight and with still stolen looks made such feint of pleasing him that Gawain marvelled much and was wroth with himself but he could not for his courtesy return her fair glances but dealt with her cunningly however she might strive to wrest the thing.
When they had tarried in the hall so long as it seemed them good they turned to the inner chamber and the wide hearthplace and there they drank wine and the host proffered to renew the covenant for New Year's Eve; but the knight craved leave to depart on the morrow for it was nigh to the term when he must fulfil his pledge. But the lord would withhold him from so doing and prayed him to tarry and said
""As I am a true knight I swear my troth that ye shall come to the Green Chapel to achieve your task on New Year's morn long before prime. Therefore abide ye in your bed and I will hunt in this wood and hold ye to the covenant to exchange with me against all the spoil I may bring hither. For twice have I tried ye and found ye true and the morrow shall be the third time and the best. Make we merry now while we may and think on joy for misfortune may take a man whensoever it wills.""
Then Gawain granted his request and they brought them drink and they gat them with lights to bed.
Sir Gawain lay and slept softly but the lord who was keen on woodcraft was afoot early. After Mass he and his men ate a morsel and he asked for his steed; all the knights who should ride with him were already mounted before the hall gates.
'Twas a fair frosty morning for the sun rose red in ruddy vapour and the welkin was clear of clouds. The hunters scattered them by a forest side and the rocks rang again with the blast of their horns. Some came on the scent of a fox and a hound gave tongue; the huntsmen shouted and the pack followed in a crowd on the trail. The fox ran before them and when they saw him they pursued him with noise and much shouting and he wound and turned through many a thick grove often cowering and hearkening in a hedge. At last by a little ditch he leapt out of a spinney stole away slily by a copse path and so out of the wood and away from the hounds. But he went ere he wist to a chosen tryst and three started forth on him at once so he must needs double back and betake him to the wood again.
Then was it joyful to hearken to the hounds; when all the pack had met together and had sight of their game they made as loud a din as if all the lofty cliffs had fallen clattering together. The huntsmen shouted and threatened and followed close upon him so that he might scarce escape but Reynard was wily and he turned and doubled upon them and led the lord and his men over the hills now on the slopes now in the vales while the knight at home slept through the cold morning beneath his costly curtains.
But the fair lady of the castle rose betimes and clad herself in a rich mantle that reached even to the ground left her throat and her fair neck bare and was bordered and lined with costly furs. On her head she wore no golden circlet but a network of precious stones that gleamed and shone through her tresses in clusters of twenty together. Thus she came into the chamber closed the door after her and set open a window and called to him gaily ""Sir Knight how may ye sleep? The morning is so fair.""
Sir Gawain was deep in slumber and in his dream he vexed him much for the destiny that should befall him on the morrow when he should meet the knight at the Green Chapel and abide his blow; but when the lady spake he heard her and came to himself and roused from his dream and answered swiftly. The lady came laughing and kissed him courteously and he welcomed her fittingly with a cheerful countenance. He saw her so glorious and gaily dressed so faultless of features and complexion that it warmed his heart to look upon her.
They spake to each other smiling and all was bliss and good cheer between them. They exchanged fair words and much happiness was therein yet was there a gulf between them and she might win no more of her knight for that gallant prince watched well his words–he would neither take her love nor frankly refuse it. He cared for his courtesy lest he be deemed churlish and yet more for his honour lest he be traitor to his host. ""God forbid"" quoth he to himself ""that it should so befall."" Thus with courteous words did he set aside all the special speeches that came from her lips.
Then spake the lady to the knight ""Ye deserve blame if ye hold not that lady who sits beside ye above all else in the world if ye have not already a love whom ye hold dearer and like better and have sworn such firm faith to that lady that ye care not to loose it–and that am I now fain to believe. And now I pray ye straitly that ye tell me that in truth and hide it not.""
And the knight answered ""By S. John"" (and he smiled as he spake) ""no such love have I nor do I think to have yet awhile.""
""That is the worst word I may hear"" quoth the lady ""but in sooth I have mine answer; kiss me now courteously and I will go hence; I can but mourn as a maiden that loves much.""
Sighing she stooped down and kissed him and then she rose up and spake as she stood ""Now dear at our parting do me this grace: give me some gift if it were but thy glove that I may bethink me of my knight and lessen my mourning.""
""Now I wis"" quoth the knight ""I would that I had here the most precious thing that I possess on earth that I might leave ye as love-token great or small for ye have deserved forsooth more reward than I might give ye. But it is not to your honour to have at this time a glove for reward as gift from Gawain and I am here on a strange errand and have no man with me nor mails with goodly things–that mislikes me much lady at this time; but each man must fare as he is taken if for sorrow and ill.""
""Nay knight highly honoured"" quoth that lovesome lady ""though I have naught of yours yet shall ye have somewhat of mine."" With that she reached him a ring of red gold with a sparkling stone therein that shone even as the sun (wit ye well it was worth many marks); but the knight refused it and spake readily
""I will take no gift lady at this time. I have none to give and none will I take.""
She prayed him to take it but he refused her prayer and sware in sooth that he would not have it.
The lady was sorely vexed and said ""If ye refuse my ring as too costly that ye will not be so highly beholden to me I will give you my girdle 11 as a lesser gift."" With that she loosened a lace that was fastened at her side knit upon her kirtle under her mantle. It was wrought of green silk and gold only braided by the fingers and that she offered to the knight and besought him though it were of little worth that he would take it and he said nay he would touch neither gold nor gear ere God give him grace to achieve the adventure for which he had come hither. ""And therefore I pray ye displease ye not and ask me no longer for I may not grant it. I am dearly beholden to ye for the favour ye have shown me and ever in heat and cold will I be your true servant.""
""Now"" said the lady ""ye refuse this silk for it is simple in itself and so it seems indeed; lo it is small to look upon and less in cost but whoso knew the virtue that is knit therein he would peradventure value it more highly. For whatever knight is girded with this green lace while he bears it knotted about him there is no man under heaven can overcome him for he may not be slain for any magic on earth.""
Then Gawain bethought him and it came into his heart that this were a jewel for the jeopardy that awaited him when he came to the Green Chapel to seek the return blow–could he so order it that he should escape unslain 'twere a craft worth trying. Then he bare with her chiding and let her say her say and she pressed the girdle on him and prayed him to take it and he granted her prayer and she gave it him with good will and besought him for her sake never to reveal it but to hide it loyally from her lord; and the knight agreed that never should any man know it save they two alone. He thanked her often and heartily and she kissed him for the third time.
Then she took her leave of him and when she was gone Sir Gawain arose and clad him in rich attire and took the girdle and knotted it round him and hid it beneath his robes. Then he took his way to the chapel and sought out a priest privily and prayed him to teach him better how his soul might be saved when he should go hence; and there he shrived him and showed his misdeeds both great and small and besought mercy and craved absolution; and the priest assoiled him and set him as clean as if Doomsday had been on the morrow. And afterwards Sir Gawain made him merry with the ladies with carols and all kinds of joy as never he did but that one day even to nightfall; and all the men marvelled at him and said that never since he came thither had he been so merry.
Meanwhile the lord of the castle was abroad chasing the fox; awhile he lost him and as he rode through a spinny he heard the hounds near at hand and Reynard came creeping through a thick grove with all the pack at his heels. Then the lord drew out his shining brand and cast it at the beast and the fox swerved aside for the sharp edge and would have doubled back but a hound was on him ere he might turn and right before the horse's feet they all fell on him and worried him fiercely snarling the while.
Then the lord leapt from his saddle and caught the fox from the jaws and held it aloft over his head and hallooed loudly and many brave hounds bayed as they beheld it; and the hunters hied them thither blowing their horns; all that bare bugles blew them at once and all the others shouted. 'Twas the merriest meeting that ever men heard the clamour that was raised at the death of the fox. They rewarded the hounds stroking them and rubbing their heads and took Reynard and stripped him of his coat; then blowing their horns they turned them homewards for it was nigh nightfall.
The lord was gladsome at his return and found a bright fire on the hearth and the knight beside it the good Sir Gawain who was in joyous mood for the pleasure he had had with the ladies. He wore a robe of blue that reached even to the ground and a surcoat richly furred that became him well. A hood like to the surcoat fell on his shoulders and all alike were done about with fur. He met the host in the midst of the floor and jesting he greeted him and said ""Now shall I be first to fulfil our covenant which we made together when there was no lack of wine."" Then he embraced the knight and kissed him thrice as solemnly as he might.
""Of a sooth"" quoth the other ""ye have good luck in the matter of this covenant if ye made a good exchange!""
""Yea it matters naught of the exchange"" quoth Gawain ""since what I owe is swiftly paid.""
""Marry"" said the other ""mine is behind for I have hunted all this day and naught have I got but this foul fox-skin and that is but poor payment for three such kisses as ye have here given me.""
""Enough"" quoth Sir Gawain ""I thank ye by the Rood.""
Then the lord told them of his hunting and how the fox had been slain.
With mirth and minstrelsy and dainties at their will they made them as merry as a folk well might till 'twas time for them to sever for at last they must needs betake them to their beds. Then the knight took his leave of the lord and thanked him fairly.
""For the fair sojourn that I have had here at this high feast may the High King give ye honour. I give ye myself as one of your servants if ye so like; for I must needs as you know go hence with the morn and ye will give me as ye promised a guide to show me the way to the Green Chapel an God will suffer me on New Year's Day to deal the doom of my weird.""
""By my faith"" quoth the host ""all that ever I promised that shall I keep with good will."" Then he gave him a servant to set him in the way and lead him by the downs that he should have no need to ford the stream and should fare by the shortest road through the groves; and Gawain thanked the lord for the honour done him. Then he would take leave of the ladies and courteously he kissed them and spake praying them to receive his thanks and they made like reply; then with many sighs they commended him to Christ and he departed courteously from that folk. Each man that he met he thanked him for his service and his solace and the pains he had been at to do his will; and each found it as hard to part from the knight as if he had ever dwelt with him.
Then they led him with torches to his chamber and brought him to his bed to rest. That he slept soundly I may not say for the morrow gave him much to think on. Let him rest awhile for he was near that which he sought and if ye will but listen to me I will tell ye how it fared with him thereafter. *****
Now the New Year drew nigh and the night passed and the day chased the darkness as is God's will; but wild weather wakened therewith. The clouds cast the cold to the earth with enough of the north to slay them that lacked clothing. The snow drave smartly and the whistling wind blew from the heights and made great drifts in the valleys. The knight lying in his bed listened for though his eyes were shut he might sleep but little and hearkened every cock that crew.
He arose ere the day broke by the light of a lamp that burned in his chamber and called to his chamberlain bidding him bring his armour and saddle his steed. The other gat him up and fetched his garments and robed Sir Gawain.
First he clad him in his clothes to keep off the cold and then in his harness which was well and fairly kept. Both hauberk and plates were well burnished the rings of the rich byrny freed from rust and all as fresh as at first so that the knight was fain to thank them. Then he did on each piece and bade them bring his steed while he put the fairest raiment on himself; his coat with its fair cognizance adorned with precious stones upon velvet with broidered seams and all furred within with costly skins. And he left not the lace the lady's gift that Gawain forgot not for his own good. When he had girded on his sword he wrapped the gift twice about him swathed around his waist. The girdle of green silk set gaily and well upon the royal red cloth rich to behold but the knight ware it not for pride of the pendants polished though they were with fair gold that gleamed brightly on the ends but to save himself from sword and knife when it behoved him to abide his hurt without question. With that the hero went forth and thanked that kindly folk full often.
Then was Gringalet ready that was great and strong and had been well cared for and tended in every wise; in fair condition was that proud steed and fit for a journey. Then Gawain went to him and looked on his coat and said by his sooth ""There is a folk in this place that thinketh on honour; much joy may they have and the lord who maintains them and may all good betide that lovely lady all her life long. Since they for charity cherish a guest and hold honour in their hands may He who holds the heaven on high requite them and also ye all. And if I might live anywhere on earth I would give ye full reward readily if so I might."" Then he set foot in the stirrup and bestrode his steed and his squire gave him his shield which he laid on his shoulder. Then he smote Gringalet with his golden spurs and the steed pranced on the stones and would stand no longer.
By that his man was mounted who bare his spear and lance and Gawain quoth ""I commend this castle to Christ may He give it ever good fortune."" Then the drawbridge was let down and the broad gates unbarred and opened on both sides; the knight crossed himself and passed through the gateway and praised the porter who knelt before the prince and gave him good-day and commended him to God. Thus the knight went on his way with the one man who should guide him to that dread place where he should receive rueful payment.
The two went by hedges where the boughs were bare and climbed the cliffs where the cold clings. Naught fell from the heavens but 'twas ill beneath them; mist brooded over the moor and hung on the mountains; each hill had a cap a great cloak of mist. The streams foamed and bubbled between their banks dashing sparkling on the shores where they shelved downwards. Rugged and dangerous was the way through the woods till it was time for the sun-rising. Then were they on a high hill; the snow lay white beside them and the man who rode with Gawain drew rein by his master.
""Sir"" he said ""I have brought ye hither and now ye are not far from the place that ye have sought so specially. But I will tell ye for sooth since I know ye well and ye are such a knight as I well love would ye follow my counsel ye would fare the better. The place whither ye go is accounted full perilous for he who liveth in that waste is the worst on earth for he is strong and fierce and loveth to deal mighty blows; taller is he than any man on earth and greater of frame than any four in Arthur's court or in any other. And this is his custom at the Green Chapel; there may no man pass by that place however proud his arms but he does him to death by force of his hand for he is a discourteous knight and shews no mercy. Be he churl or chaplain who rides by that chapel monk or mass priest or any man else he thinks it as pleasant to slay them as to pass alive himself. Therefore I tell ye as sooth as ye sit in saddle if ye come there and that knight know it ye shall be slain though ye had twenty lives; trow me that truly! He has dwelt here full long and seen many a combat; ye may not defend ye against his blows. Therefore good Sir Gawain let the man be and get ye away some other road; for God's sake seek ye another land and there may Christ speed ye! And I will hie me home again and I promise ye further that I will swear by God and the saints or any other oath ye please that I will keep counsel faithfully and never let any wit the tale that ye fled for fear of any man.""
""Gramercy"" quoth Gawain but ill-pleased. ""Good fortune be his who wishes me good and that thou wouldst keep faith with me I will believe; but didst thou keep it never so truly an I passed here and fled for fear as thou sayest then were I a coward knight and might not be held guiltless. So I will to the chapel let chance what may and talk with that man even as I may list whether for weal or for woe as fate may have it. Fierce though he may be in fight yet God knoweth well how to save His servants.""
""Well"" quoth the other ""now that ye have said so much that ye will take your own harm on yourself and ye be pleased to lose your life I will neither let nor keep ye. Have here your helm and the spear in your hand and ride down this same road beside the rock till ye come to the bottom of the valley and there look a little to the left hand and ye shall see in that vale the chapel and the grim man who keeps it. Now fare ye well noble Gawain; for all the gold on earth I would not go with ye nor bear ye fellowship one step further."" With that the man turned his bridle into the wood smote the horse with his spurs as hard as he could and galloped off leaving the knight alone.
Quoth Gawain ""I will neither greet nor groan but commend myself to God and yield me to His will.""
Then the knight spurred Gringalet and rode adown the path close in by a bank beside a grove. So he rode through the rough thicket right into the dale and there he halted for it seemed him wild enough. No sign of a chapel could he see but high and burnt banks on either side and rough rugged crags with great stones above. An ill-looking place he thought it.
Then he drew in his horse and looked around to seek the chapel but he saw none and thought it strange. Then he saw as it were a mound on a level space of land by a bank beside the stream where it ran swiftly the water bubbled within as if boiling. The knight turned his steed to the mound and lighted down and tied the rein to the branch of a linden; and he turned to the mound and walked round it questioning with himself what it might be. It had a hole at the end and at either side and was overgrown with clumps of grass and it was hollow within as an old cave or the crevice of a crag; he knew not what it might be.
""Ah"" quoth Gawain ""can this be the Green Chapel? Here might the devil say his mattins at midnight! Now I wis there is wizardry here. 'Tis an ugly oratory all overgrown with grass and 'twould well beseem that fellow in green to say his devotions on devil's wise. Now feel I in five wits 'tis the foul fiend himself who hath set me this tryst to destroy me here! This is a chapel of mischance: ill-luck betide it 'tis the cursedest kirk that ever I came in!""
Helmet on head and lance in hand he came up to the rough dwelling when he heard over the high hill beyond the brook as it were in a bank a wondrous fierce noise that rang in the cliff as if it would cleave asunder. 'Twas as if one ground a scythe on a grindstone it whirred and whetted like water on a mill-wheel and rushed and rang terrible to hear.
""By God"" quoth Gawain ""I trow that gear is preparing for the knight who will meet me here. Alas! naught may help me yet should my life be forfeit I fear not a jot!"" With that he called aloud. ""Who waiteth in this place to give me tryst? Now is Gawain come hither: if any man will aught of him let him hasten hither now or never.""
""Stay"" quoth one on the bank above his head ""and ye shall speedily have that which I promised ye."" Yet for a while the noise of whetting went on ere he appeared and then he came forth from a cave in the crag with a fell weapon a Danish axe newly dight wherewith to deal the blow. An evil head it had four feet large no less sharply ground and bound to the handle by the lace that gleamed brightly. And the knight himself was all green as before face and foot locks and beard but now he was afoot. When he came to the water he would not wade it but sprang over with the pole of his axe and strode boldly over the brent that was white with snow.
Sir Gawain went to meet him but he made no low bow. The other said ""Now fair sir one may trust thee to keep tryst. Thou art welcome Gawain to my place. Thou hast timed thy coming as befits a true man. Thou knowest the covenant set between us: at this time twelve months agone thou didst take that which fell to thee and I at this New Year will readily requite thee. We are in this valley verily alone here are no knights to sever us do what we will. Have off thy helm from thine head and have here thy pay; make me no more talking than I did then when thou didst strike off my head with one blow.""
""Nay"" quoth Gawain ""by God that gave me life I shall make no moan whatever befall me but make thou ready for the blow and I shall stand still and say never a word to thee do as thou wilt.""
With that he bent his head and shewed his neck all bare and made as if he had no fear for he would not be thought a-dread.
Then the Green Knight made him ready and grasped his grim weapon to smite Gawain. With all his force he bore it aloft with a mighty feint of slaying him: had it fallen as straight as he aimed he who was ever doughty of deed had been slain by the blow. But Gawain swerved aside as the axe came gliding down to slay him as he stood and shrank a little with the shoulders for the sharp iron. The other heaved up the blade and rebuked the prince with many proud words:
""Thou art not Gawain"" he said ""who is held so valiant that never feared he man by hill or vale but thou shrinkest for fear ere thou feelest hurt. Such cowardice did I never hear of Gawain! Neither did I flinch from thy blow or make strife in King Arthur's hall. My head fell to my feet and yet I fled not; but thou didst wax faint of heart ere any harm befell. Wherefore must I be deemed the braver knight.""
Quoth Gawain ""I shrank once but so will I no more though an my head fall on the stones I cannot replace it. But haste Sir Knight by thy faith and bring me to the point deal me my destiny and do it out of hand for I will stand thee a stroke and move no more till thine axe have hit me–my troth on it.""
""Have at thee then"" quoth the other and heaved aloft the axe with fierce mien as if he were mad. He struck at him fiercely but wounded him not withholding his hand ere it might strike him.
Gawain abode the stroke and flinched in no limb but stood still as a stone or the stump of a tree that is fast rooted in the rocky ground with a hundred roots.
Then spake gaily the man in green ""So now thou hast thine heart whole it behoves me to smite. Hold aside thy hood that Arthur gave thee and keep thy neck thus bent lest it cover it again.""
Then Gawain said angrily ""Why talk on thus? Thou dost threaten too long. I hope thy heart misgives thee.""
""For sooth"" quoth the other ""so fiercely thou speakest I will no longer let thine errand wait its reward."" Then he braced himself to strike frowning with lips and brow 'twas no marvel that it pleased but ill him who hoped for no rescue. He lifted the axe lightly and let it fall with the edge of the blade on the bare neck. Though he struck swiftly it hurt him no more than on the one side where it severed the skin. The sharp blade cut into the flesh so that the blood ran over his shoulder to the ground. And when the knight saw the blood staining the snow he sprang forth swift-foot more than a spear's length seized his helmet and set it on his head cast his shield over his shoulder drew out his bright sword and spake boldly (never since he was born was he half so blithe) ""Stop Sir Knight bid me no more blows. I have stood a stroke here without flinching and if thou give me another I shall requite thee and give thee as good again. By the covenant made betwixt us in Arthur's hall but one blow falls to me here. Halt therefore.""
Then the Green Knight drew off from him and leaned on his axe setting the shaft on the ground and looked on Gawain as he stood all armed and faced him fearlessly–at heart it pleased him well. Then he spake merrily in a loud voice and said to the knight ""Bold sir be not so fierce no man here hath done thee wrong nor will do save by covenant as we made at Arthur's court. I promised thee a blow and thou hast it–hold thyself well paid! I release thee of all other claims. If I had been so minded I might perchance have given thee a rougher buffet. First I menaced thee with a feigned one and hurt thee not for the covenant that we made in the first night and which thou didst hold truly. All the gain didst thou give me as a true man should. The other feint I proffered thee for the morrow: my fair wife kissed thee and thou didst give me her kisses–for both those days I gave thee two blows without scathe–true man true return. But the third time thou didst fail and therefore hadst thou that blow. For 'tis my weed thou wearest that same woven girdle my own wife wrought it that do I wot for sooth. Now know I well thy kisses and thy conversation and the wooing of my wife for 'twas mine own doing. I sent her to try thee and in sooth I think thou art the most faultless knight that ever trode earth. As a pearl among white peas is of more worth than they so is Gawain i' faith by other knights. But thou didst lack a little Sir Knight and wast wanting in loyalty yet that was for no evil work nor for wooing neither but because thou lovedst thy life–therefore I blame thee the less.""
Then the other stood a great while still sorely angered and vexed within himself; all the blood flew to his face and he shrank for shame as the Green Knight spake; and the first words he said were ""Cursed be ye cowardice and covetousness for in ye is the destruction of virtue."" Then he loosed the girdle and gave it to the knight. ""Lo take there the falsity may foul befall it! For fear of thy blow cowardice bade me make friends with covetousness and forsake the customs of largess and loyalty which befit all knights. Now am I faulty and false and have been afeared: from treachery and untruth come sorrow and care. I avow to thee Sir Knight that I have ill done; do then thy will. I shall be more wary hereafter.""
Then the other laughed and said gaily ""I wot I am whole of the hurt I had and thou hast made such free confession of thy misdeeds and hast so borne the penance of mine axe edge that I hold thee absolved from that sin and purged as clean as if thou hadst never sinned since thou wast born. And this girdle that is wrought with gold and green like my raiment do I give thee Sir Gawain that thou mayest think upon this chance when thou goest forth among princes of renown and keep this for a token of the adventure of the Green Chapel as it chanced between chivalrous knights. And thou shalt come again with me to my dwelling and pass the rest of this feast in gladness."" Then the lord laid hold of him and said ""I wot we shall soon make peace with my wife who was thy bitter enemy.""
""Nay forsooth"" said Sir Gawain and seized his helmet and took it off swiftly and thanked the knight: ""I have fared ill may bliss betide thee and may He who rules all things reward thee swiftly. Commend me to that courteous lady thy fair wife and to the other my honoured ladies who have beguiled their knight with skilful craft. But 'tis no marvel if one be made a fool and brought to sorrow by women's wiles for so was Adam beguiled by one and Solomon by many and Samson all too soon for Delilah dealt him his doom; and David thereafter was wedded with Bathsheba which brought him much sorrow–if one might love a woman and believe her not 'twere great gain! And since all they were beguiled by women methinks 'tis the less blame to me that I was misled! But as for thy girdle that will I take with good will not for gain of the gold nor for samite nor silk nor the costly pendants neither for weal nor for worship but in sign of my frailty. I shall look upon it when I ride in renown and remind myself of the fault and faintness of the flesh; and so when pride uplifts me for prowess of arms the sight of this lace shall humble my heart. But one thing would I pray if it displease thee not: since thou art lord of yonder land wherein I have dwelt tell me what thy rightful name may be and I will ask no more.""
""That will I truly"" quoth the other. ""Bernlak de Hautdesert am I called in this land. Morgain le Fay dwelleth in mine house 12 and through knowledge of clerkly craft hath she taken many. For long time was she the mistress of Merlin who knew well all you knights of the court. Morgain the goddess is she called therefore and there is none so haughty but she can bring him low. She sent me in this guise to yon fair hall to test the truth of the renown that is spread abroad of the valour of the Round Table. She taught me this marvel to betray your wits to vex Guinevere and fright her to death by the man who spake with his head in his hand at the high table. That is she who is at home that ancient lady she is even thine aunt Arthur's half-sister the daughter of the Duchess of Tintagel who afterward married King Uther. Therefore I bid thee knight come to thine aunt and make merry in thine house; my folk love thee and I wish thee as well as any man on earth by my faith for thy true dealing.""
But Sir Gawain said nay he would in no wise do so; so they embraced and kissed and commended each other to the Prince of Paradise and parted right there on the cold ground. Gawain on his steed rode swiftly to the king's hall and the Green Knight got him whithersoever he would.
Sir Gawain who had thus won grace of his life rode through wild ways on Gringalet; oft he lodged in a house and oft without and many adventures did he have and came off victor full often as at this time I cannot relate in tale. The hurt that he had in his neck was healed he bare the shining girdle as a baldric bound by his side and made fast with a knot 'neath his left arm in token that he was taken in a fault–and thus he came in safety again to the court.
Then joy awakened in that dwelling when the king knew that the good Sir Gawain was come for he deemed it gain. King Arthur kissed the knight and the queen also and many valiant knights sought to embrace him. They asked him how he had fared and he told them all that had chanced to him–the adventure of the chapel the fashion of the knight the love of the lady–at last of the lace. He showed them the wound in the neck which he won for his disloyalty at the hand of the knight the blood flew to his face for shame as he told the tale.
""Lo lady"" he quoth and handled the lace ""this is the bond of the blame that I bear in my neck this is the harm and the loss I have suffered the cowardice and covetousness in which I was caught the token of my covenant in which I was taken. And I must needs wear it so long as I live for none may hide his harm but undone it may not be for if it hath clung to thee once it may never be severed.""
Then the king comforted the knight and the court laughed loudly at the tale and all made accord that the lords and the ladies who belonged to the Round Table each hero among them should wear bound about him a baldric of bright green for the sake of Sir Gawain.13 And to this was agreed all the honour of the Round Table and he who ware it was honoured the more thereafter as it is testified in the best book of romance. That in Arthur's days this adventure befell the book of Brutus bears witness. For since that bold knight came hither first and the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy I wis

Many a venture herebefore
Hath fallen such as this:
May He that bare the crown of thorn
Bring us unto His bliss.

Amen.


Footnotes

1. ""The Legend of Sir Gawain"" Grimm Library Vol. VII. (Chapter IX. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight).

2. Dance accompanied by song. Often mentioned in old romances.

3. Agravain ""à la dure main."" This characterisation of Gawain's brother seems to indicate that there was a French source at the root of this story. The author distinctly tells us more than once that the tale as he tells it was written in a book M. Gaston Paris thinks that the direct source was an Anglo-Norman poem now lost.

4. If any in this hall holds himself so hardy. This the main incident of the tale is apparently of very early date. The oldest version we possess is that found in the Irish tale of the Fled Bricrend (Bricriu's feast) [edited and translated by the Rev. G. Henderson M.A. Irish Texts Society vol. ii.] where the hero of the tale is the Irish champion Cuchulinn. Two mediæval romances the Mule sans Frein (French) and Diu Krône (German) again attribute it to Gawain; while the continuator of Chrétien de Troye's Conte del Graal gives as hero a certain Carados whom he represents as Arthur's nephew; and the prose Perceval has Lancelot. So far as the mediæval versions are concerned the original hero is undoubtedly Gawain; and our poem gives the fullest and most complete form of the story we possess. In the Irish version the magician is a giant and the abnormal size and stature of the Green Knight is in all probability the survival of a primitive feature. His curious colour is a trait found nowhere else. In Diu Krône we are told that the challenger changes shapes in a terrifying manner but no details are given.

5. For Yule was over-past. This passage descriptive of the flight of the year should be especially noticed. Combined with the other passages–the description of Gawain's journey the early morning hunts the dawning of New Year's Day and the ride to the Green Chapel–they indicate a knowledge of Nature and an observant eye for her moods uncommon among mediæval poets. It is usual enough to find graceful and charming descriptions of spring and early summer–an appreciation of May in especial when the summer courts were held is part of the stock-in-trade of mediæval romancers–but a sympathy with the year in all its changes is far rarer and certainly deserves to be specially reckoned to the credit of this nameless writer.

6. First a rich carpet was stretched on the floor. The description of the arming of Gawain is rather more detailed in the original but some of the minor points are not easy to understand the identification of sundry of the pieces of armour being doubtful.

7. The pentangle painted thereupon in gleaming gold. I do not remember that the pentangle is elsewhere attributed to Gawain. He often bears a red shield; but the blazon varies. Indeed the heraldic devices borne by Arthur's knights are distractingly chaotic–their legends are older than the science of heraldry and no one has done for them the good office that the compiler of the Thidrek Saga has rendered to his Teutonic heroes.

8. The Wilderness of Wirral. This is in Cheshire. Sir F. Madden suggests that the forest which forms the final stage of Gawain's journey is that of Inglewood in Cumberland. The geography here is far clearer than is often the case in such descriptions.

9. 'Twas the fairest castle that ever a knight owned. Here again I have omitted some of the details of the original the architectural terms lacking identification.

10. With blast of the bugle fared forth to the field. The account of each day's hunting contains a number of obsolete terms and details of woodcraft not given in full. The meaning of some has been lost and the minute descriptions of skinning and dismembering the game would be distinctly repulsive to the general reader. They are valuable for a student of the history of the English sport but interfere with the progress of the story. The fact that the author devotes so much space to them seems to indicate that he lived in the country and was keenly interested in field sports. (Gottfried von Strassbourg's Tristan contains a similar and almost more detailed description.)

11. I will give [you] my girdle. This magic girdle which confers invulnerability on its owner is a noticeable feature of our story. It is found nowhere else in this connection yet in other romances we find that Gawain possesses a girdle with similar powers (cf. my Legend of Sir Gawain Chap. IX.). Such a talisman was also owned by Cuchulinn the Irish hero who has many points of contact with Gawain. It seems not improbable that this was also an old feature of the story. I have commented in the Introduction on the lady's persistent wooing of Gawain and need not repeat the remarks here. The Celtic Lay of the Great Fool (Amadan Mor) presents some curious points of contact with our story which may however well be noted here. In the Lay the hero is mysteriously deprived of his legs through the draught from a cup proffered by a Gruagach or magician. He comes to a castle the lord of which goes out hunting leaving his wife in the care of the Great Fool who is to allow no man to enter. He falls asleep and a young knight arrives and kisses the host's wife. The Great Fool awaking refuses to allow the intruder to depart; and in spite of threats and blandishments insists on detaining him till the husband returns. Finally the stranger reveals himself as the host in another shape; he is also the Gruagach who deprived the hero of his limbs and the Great Fool's brother. He has only intended to test the Amadon Mor's fidelity. A curious point in connection with this story is that it possesses a prose opening which shows a marked affinity with the ""Perceval"" enfances. That the Perceval and Gawain stories early became connected is certain but what is the precise connection between them and the Celtic Lay is not clear. In its present form the latter is certainly posterior to the Grail romances but it is quite possible that the matter with which it deals represents a tradition older than the Arthurian story.

12. Morgain le Fay who dwelleth in my house. The enmity between Morgain le Fay and Guinevere which is here stated to have been the motif of the enchantment is no invention of the author but is found in the Merlin probably the earliest of the Arthurian prose romances. In a later version of our story a poem written in ballad form and contained in the ""Percy"" MS. Morgain does not appear; her place is taken by an old witch mother to the lady but the enchantment is still due to her spells. In this later form the knight bears the curious name of Sir Bredbeddle. That given in our romance Bernlak de Hautdesert seems to point to the original French source of the story. (It is curious that Morgain should here be represented as extremely old while Arthur is still in his first youth. There is evidently a discrepancy or misunderstanding of the source here.)

13. A baldric of bright green for sake of Sir Gawain. The later version connects this lace with that worn by the knights of the Bath; but this latter was white not green. The knights wore it on the left shoulder till they had done some gallant deed or till some noble lady took it off for them.

Once in royal David's city
Stood a lowly cattle shed
Where a mother laid her Baby
In a manger for His bed:
Mary was that mother mild
Jesus Christ her little Child

He came down to earth from heaven
Who is God and Lord of all
And His shelter was a stable
And His cradle was a stall;
With the poor and mean and lowly
Lived on earth our Saviour holy

And our eyes at last shall see Him
Through His own redeeming love;
For that Child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heaven above
And He leads His children on
To the place where He is gone
Not in that poor lowly stable
With the oxen standing by
We shall see Him; but in heaven
Set at God's right hand on high;
When like stars His children crowned
All in white shall wait around

O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see Thee lie
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in Thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the Holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth

How silently how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven
No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him
Still the dear Christ enters in

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the Blessed Child
Where misery cries out to Thee
Son of the Mother mild
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door
The dark night wakes the glory breaks
And Christmas comes once more

O Holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel

Going through the hills on a night all starry
On the way to Bethlehem
Far away I heard a shepherd boy piping
On the way to Bethlehem

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for joy that Christ the newborn King
Is come to bring us peace on earth
And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem.""

""Tell me shepherd boy piping tunes so merrily
On the way to Bethlehem
Who will hear your tunes on these hills so lonely
On the way to Bethlehem?

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for the joy that Christ the newborn King
Is come to bring peace on earth
And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem.""

""None may hear my pipes on these hills so lonely
On the way to Bethlehem;
But a King will hear me play sweet lullabies
When I get to Bethlehem.""

Angels in the sky came down from on high
Hovered over the manger where the babe was lying
Cradled in the arms of his mother Mary
Sleeping now at Bethlehem

""Where is the new King shepherd boy piping merrily
Is He there at Bethlehem?""
""I will find Him soon by the star shining brightly
In the sky o'vr Bethlehem.""

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for joy that Christ the king of Kings
Is come to bring us peace on earth
And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem.""

""May I come with you shepherd boy piping merrily
Come with you to Bethlehem?
Pay my homage too at the new King's cradle
Is it far to Bethlehem?""

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for joy that Christ the newborn King
Is born in the stable yonder born for you and me.""

You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donder and Blitzen.
But do you recall?
The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

Little Lamb who made thee
Dost thou know who made thee
Gave thee life & bid thee feed
By the stream & o'er the mead;
Gave thee clothing of delight
Softest clothing wooly bright;
Gave thee such a tender voice
Making all the vales rejoice!
Little Lamb who made thee
Dost thou know who made thee

Little Lamb I'll tell thee
Little Lamb I'll tell thee!
He is called by thy name
For he calls himself a Lamb:
He is meek & he is mild
He became a little child:
I a child & thou a lamb
We are called by his name
Little Lamb God bless thee
Little Lamb God bless thee

They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
But instead it just kept on raining
A veil of tears for the Virgin Birth
I remember one Christmas Morning
A winters light and a distant choir
And the peal of a bell and that Christmas Tree smell
And their eyes full of tinsel and fire

They sold me a dream of Christmas
They sold me a Silent Night
They told me a fairy story
'Till I believed in the Israelite
And I believed in Father Christmas
And I looked to the Sky with excited eyes
'Till I woke with a yawn in the first Light of dawn
And I saw him and through his disguise

I wish you a hopeful Christmas
I wish you a brave New Year
All anguish pain and sadness
Leave your Heart and let your road be clear
They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
Hallelujah Noel be it Heaven or hell
The Christmas we get we deserve

Dear citizens of the world we are Anonymous. Let's get one thing perfectly clear to my subscribers and supporters: you may remember me as the one who organized the complete shutdown of Anonymous Operations. Abroad to Anonymous that successfully waged cyber war against Turkey Hungary CloudFlare and Donald Trump you may think I silenced the attacks as a Donald Trump supporter but that is far from the truth. In fact the only thing they ever accomplished that we admired we: the lowerests and the veterans of Anonymous have decided to [?] this operation on a far larger scale.

Dear Donald Trump we have been watching you for a long time and we see is deeply disturbing.
When do we beat Mexico –at the border? —They are not our friend.—They're rapists.—You gotta see this guy: 'Uh I don't know what I said uh I don't remember!'—I'm right now suing Univision for five-hundred million dollars. [sic] We're gonna win a lot of money.
(Megyn Kelly: You call women you don't like 'fat pigs' 'dogs' 'slobs' and 'disgusting animals.')—""You know you can see blood comin' out of her eyes uh blood coming out of her wherever.""—So uh because it will be fun. I'd like to take some money out of her fat-ass pockets.—Although she does have some very nice husband I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter perhaps I'd be dating her.Your inconsistent and hateful campaign has not only: shocked the United States of America you have shocked the entire planet with your appalling actions and ideas. You say what your current audience wants to hear but in reality you don't really stand for anything except for your personal greed and power. This is a cult laws. This is a cult of a freedom fighters who have forgotten to be censored. Though our fellow hacktivists throughout the world: this is a cult of protectile future our freedom and our very way of life.

It's a narrow narrow make your bed
And learn to lie your lane;
For I'm ga'n oer the sea Fair Annie
A braw bride to bring hame.
Wi her I will get gowd and gear;
Wi you I neer got nane.
""But wha will bake my bridal bread
Or brew my bridal ale?
And wha will welcome my brisk bride
That I bring oer the dale?""
""It's I will bake your bridal bread
And brew your bridal ale
And I will welcome your brisk bride
That you bring oer the dale.""
""But she that welcomes my brisk bride
Maun gang like maiden fair;
She maun lace on her robe sae jimp
And braid her yellow hair.""
""But how can I gang maiden-like
When maiden I am nane?
Have I not born seven sons to thee
And am with child again?""
She's taen her young son in her arms
Another in her hand
And she's up to the highest tower
To see him come to land.
""Come up come up my eldest son
And look oer yon sea-strand
And see your father's new-come bride
Before she come to land.""
""Come down come down my mother dear
Come frae the castle wa!
I fear if langer ye stand there
Ye'll let yoursell down fa.""
And she gaed down and farther down
Her love's ship for to see
And the topmast and the mainmast
Shone like the silver free.
And she's gane down and farther down
The bride's ship to behold
And the topmast and the mainmast
They shone just like the gold.
She's taen her seven sons in her hand
I wot she didna fail;
She met Lord Thomas and his bride
As they came oer the dale.
""You're welcome to your house Lord Thomas
You're welcome to your land;
You're welcome with your fair ladye
That you lead by the hand.
""You're welcome to your ha's ladye
You're welcome to your bowers;
You're welcome to your hame ladye
For a' that's here is yours.""
""I thank thee Annie; I thank thee Annie
Sae dearly as I thank thee;
You're the likest to my sister Annie
That ever I did see.
""There came a knight out oer the sea
And steald my sister away;
The shame scoup in his company
And land whereer he gae!""
She hang ae napkin at the door
Another in the ha
And a' to wipe the trickling tears
Sae fast as they did fa.
And aye she served the lang tables
With white bread and with wine
And aye she drank the wan water
To had her colour fine.
And he's taen down the silk napkin
Hung on a silver pin
And aye he wipes the tear trickling
A' down her cheik and chin.
And aye he turn'd him round about
And smil'd amang his men;
Says ""Like ye best the old ladye
Or her that's new come hame?""
When bells were rung and mass was sung
And a' men bound to bed
Lord Thomas and his new-come bride
To their chamber they were gaed.
Annie made her bed a little forbye
To hear what they might say;
""And ever alas!"" Fair Annie cried
""That I should see this day!
""Gin my seven sons were seven young rats
Running on the castle wa
And I were a grey cat mysell
I soon would worry them a'.
""Gin my seven sons were seven young hares
Running oer yon lilly lee
And I were a grew hound mysell
Soon worried they a' should be.""
And wae and sad Fair Annie sat
And drearie was her sang
And ever as she sobbd and grat
""Wae to the man that did the wrang!""
""My gown is on"" said the new-come bride
""My shoes are on my feet
And I will to Fair Annie's chamber
And see what gars her greet.
""What ails ye what ails ye Fair Annie
That ye make sic a moan?
Has your wine barrels cast the girds
Or is your white bread gone?
""O wha was't was your father Annie
Or wha was't was your mother?
And had ye ony sister Annie
Or had ye ony brother?""
""The Earl of Wemyss was my father
The Countess of Wemyss my mother;
And a' the folk about the house
To me were sister and brother.
""If the Earl of Wemyss was your father
I wot sae was he mine;
And it shall not be for lack o gowd
That ye your love sall tine.
""For I have seven ships o mine ain
A' loaded to the brim
And I will gie them a' to thee
Wi four to thine eldest son:
But thanks to a' the powers in heaven
That I gae maiden hame!

In the bleak midwinter frost wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron water like a stone;
Snow had fallen snow on snow snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter long ago
Our god heaven cannot hold him nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The lord God almighty jesus christ
Angels and archangels may have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
But his mother only in her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss
What can I give him poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb;
If I were a wise man I would do my part;
Yet what I can I give him: give my heart

The tree of life my soul hath seen
Laden with fruit and always green:
The trees of nature fruitless be
Compared with Christ the apple tree

His beauty doth all things excel:
By faith I know but ne'er can tell
The glory which I now can see
In Jesus Christ the apple tree

For happiness I long have sought
And pleasure dearly I have bought:
I missed of all; but now I see
'Tis found in Christ the apple tree

I'm weary with my former toil
Here I will sit and rest awhile:
Under the shadow I will be
Of Jesus Christ the apple tree

This fruit doth make my soul to thrive
It keeps my dying faith alive;
Which makes my soul in haste to be
With Jesus Christ the apple tree

Born in a stable so bare
Born so long ago
Born 'neath light of star
He who loved us so
Far away silent he lay
Born today your homage pay

Born on Christmas Day
Cradled by mother so fair
Tender her lullaby
Over her son so dear
Angel hosts fill the sky
Far away silent he lay
Born today your homage pay
For Christ is born for aye
Born on Christmas Day
Wise men from distant far land
Sheperds from starry hills
Worship this babe so rare
Hearts with his warmth he fills
Far away silent he lay
Born today your homage pay
For Christ is born for aye
Born on Christmas Day
Love in that stable was born
Into our hearts to flow
Innocent dreaming babe
Make me thy love to know
Far away silent he lay
Born today your homage pay
For Christ is born for aye
Born on Christmas Day

How do you capture the wind on the water?
How do you count all the stars in the sky?
How can you measure the love of a mother?
Or how can you write down a baby's first cry?

Candlelight angel light firelight and star-glow
Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn
Gloria! Gloria in excelsis deo
Angels are singing; the Christ child is born

Shepherds and wise men will kneel and adore him
Seraphim round him their vigil will keep
Nations proclaim him their Lord and their Saviour
But Mary will hold him and sing him to sleep

Candlelight angel light firelight and star-glow
Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn
Gloria! Gloria in excelsis deo
Angels are singing; the Christ child is born

Find him at Bethlehem laid in a manger
Christ our Redeemer asleep in the hay
Godhead incarnate and hope of salvation
A child with his mother that first Christmas Day

Candlelight angel light firelight and star-glow
Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn
Gloria! Gloria in excelsis deo
Angels are singing; the Christ child is born

I.

       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep mine Holy One!
My flesh my Lord!—what name? I do not know
A name that seemeth not too high or low
       &nbsp       &nbspToo far from me or heaven:
My Jesus that is best! that word being given
By the majestic angel whose command
Was softly as a man's beseeching said
When I and all the earth appeared to stand
       &nbsp       &nbspIn the great overflow
Of light celestial from his wings and head.
       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep my saving One!


II.

And art Thou come for saving baby-browed
And speechless Being—art Thou come for saving?
The palm that grows beside our door is bowed
By treadings of the low wind from the south
A restless shadow through the chamber waving:
Upon its bough a bird sings in the sun
But Thou with that close slumber on Thy mouth
Dost seem of wind and sun already weary.
Art come for saving O my weary One?

III.

Perchance this sleep that shutteth out the dreary
Earth-sounds and motions opens on Thy soul
       &nbspHigh dreams on fire with God;
High songs that make the pathways where they roll
More bright than stars do theirs; and visions new
Of Thine eternal Nature's old abode.
       &nbspSuffer this mother's kiss
       &nbspBest thing that earthly is
To glide the music and the glory through
Nor narrow in Thy dream the broad upliftings
       &nbspOf any seraph wing.
Thus noiseless thus. Sleep sleep my dreaming One!

IV.

The slumber of His lips meseems to run
Through my lips to mine heart to all its shiftings
Of sensual life bringing contrariousness
In a great calm. I feel I could lie down
As Moses did and die[7]—and then live most.
I am 'ware of you heavenly Presences
That stand with your peculiar light unlost
Each forehead with a high thought for a crown
Unsunned i' the sunshine! I am 'ware. Ye throw
No shade against the wall! How motionless
Ye round me with your living statuary
While through your whiteness in and outwardly
Continual thoughts of God appear to go
Like light's soul in itself. I bear I bear
To look upon the dropt lids of your eyes
Though their external shining testifies
To that beatitude within which were
Enough to blast an eagle at his sun:
I fall not on my sad clay face before ye—
       &nbsp       &nbspI look on His. I know
My spirit which dilateth with the woe
       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspOf His mortality
       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspMay well contain your glory.
       &nbsp       &nbspYea drop your lids more low.
Ye are but fellow-worshippers with me!
       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep my worshipped One!


V.

We sate among the stalls at Bethlehem;
The dumb kine from their fodder turning them
       &nbspSoftened their hornèd faces
       &nbspTo almost human gazes
       &nbspToward the newly Born:
The simple shepherds from the star-lit brooks
       &nbspBrought visionary looks
As yet in their astonied hearing rung
       &nbspThe strange sweet angel-tongue:
The magi of the East in sandals worn
       &nbspKnelt reverent sweeping round
With long pale beards their gifts upon the ground
       &nbspThe incense myrrh and gold
These baby hands were impotent to hold:
So let all earthlies and celestials wait
       &nbspUpon Thy royal state.
       &nbspSleep sleep my kingly One!

VI.

I am not proud—meek angels ye invest
New meeknesses to hear such utterance rest
On mortal lips—""I am not proud""—not proud!
Albeit in my flesh God sent His Son
Albeit over Him my head is bowed
As others bow before Him still mine heart
Bows lower than their knees. O centuries
That roll in vision your futurities
       &nbsp       &nbspMy future grave athwart—
Whose murmurs seem to reach me while I keep
       &nbsp       &nbspWatch o'er this sleep—
Say of me as the Heavenly said—""Thou art
The blessedest of women!""—blessedest
Not holiest not noblest no high name
Whose height misplaced may pierce me like a shame
When I sit meek in heaven!
       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspFor me for me
God knows that I am feeble like the rest!
I often wandered forth more child than maiden
Among the midnight hills of Galilee
       &nbsp       &nbspWhose summits looked heaven-laden
Listening to silence as it seemed to be
God's voice so soft yet strong so fain to press
Upon my heart as heaven did on the height
And waken up its shadows by a light
And show its vileness by a holiness.
Then I knelt down most silent like the night
       &nbsp       &nbspToo self-renounced for fears
Raising my small face to the boundless blue
Whose stars did mix and tremble in my tears:
God heard them falling after with His dew.

VII.

So seeing my corruption can I see
This Incorruptible now born of me
This fair new Innocence no sun did chance
To shine on (for even Adam was no child)
Created from my nature all defiled
This mystery from out mine ignorance—
Nor feel the blindness stain corruption more
Than others do or I did heretofore?
Can hands wherein such burden pure has been
Not open with the cry ""unclean unclean""
More oft than any else beneath the skies?
       &nbsp       &nbspAh King ah Christ ah son!
The kine the shepherds the abasèd wise
       &nbsp       &nbspMust all less lowly wait
       &nbsp       &nbspThan I upon Thy state.
       &nbspSleep sleep my kingly One!

VIII.

Art Thou a King then? Come His universe
Come crown me Him a King!
Pluck rays from all such stars as never fling
       &nbspTheir light where fell a curse
And make a crowning for this kingly brow!—
What is my word? Each empyreal star
       &nbsp       &nbspSits in a sphere afar
       &nbsp       &nbspIn shining ambuscade:
       &nbsp       &nbspThe child-brow crowned by none
       &nbsp       &nbspKeeps its unchildlike shade.
       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep my crownless One!

IX.

Unchildlike shade! No other babe doth wear
An aspect very sorrowful as Thou.
No small babe-smiles my watching heart has seen
To float like speech the speechless lips between
No dovelike cooing in the golden air
No quick short joys of leaping babyhood.
       &nbsp       &nbspAlas our earthly good
In heaven thought evil seems too good for Thee;
       &nbsp       &nbspYet sleep my weary One!

X.

And then the drear sharp tongue of prophecy
With the dread sense of things which shall be done
Doth smite me inly like a sword: a sword?
That ""smites the Shepherd."" Then I think aloud
The words ""despised""—""rejected""—every word
Recoiling into darkness as I view
       &nbsp       &nbspThe Darling on my knee.
Bright angels—move not—lest ye stir the cloud
Betwixt my soul and His futurity!
I must not die with mother's work to do
       &nbsp       &nbspAnd could not live-and see.

XI.

       &nbspIt is enough to bear
       &nbspThis image still and fair
       &nbspThis holier in sleep
       &nbspThan a saint at prayer
       &nbspThis aspect of a child
       &nbspWho never sinned or smiled;
       &nbspThis Presence in an infant's face;
       &nbspThis sadness most like love
       &nbspThis love than love more deep
       &nbspThis weakness like omnipotence
       &nbspIt is so strong to move.
       &nbspAwful is this watching place
       &nbspAwful what I see from hence—
       &nbspA king without regalia
       &nbspA God without the thunder
       &nbspA child without the heart for play;
       &nbspAy a Creator rent asunder
       &nbspFrom His first glory and cast away
       &nbspOn His own world for me alone
To hold in hands created crying—Son!

XII.

       &nbspThat tear fell not on Thee
Beloved yet thou stirrest in thy slumber!
Thou stirring not for glad sounds out of number
Which through the vibratory palm-trees run
       &nbspFrom summer-wind and bird
       &nbspSo quickly hast thou heard
       &nbspA tear fall silently?
       &nbspWak'st thou O loving One?—

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh I wanna have him beside me like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th by that fireplace oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh baby
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
If he will be if he will be here
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
Oh woah

[Chorus]
Santa tell me (Santa tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be if he won't be here)

'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Christmas coming around again eh?
Yeah I mean it must be nearly a year since the last one
Oh it's a good twelve months
Yeah yeah
You getting anything for your Granny this year?
Well I thought about it I couldn't be bothered
Well it's the thought that counts innit
Yeah that's how I see it
What do you fancy for Christmas then
Kim Wilde as usual kidding myself though arent't I
It's hopeless really it's pathetic I suppose in a way
It is yeah - hello who is this?
Merry Christmas Melvyn
It can't be
Come on Mel how about pulling a cracker
By the look of you darling I think I already have
Get it

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple try to stop
Come on Melly-pops

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
Pumpkin pie anyone?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
This is so corny
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Wow I am in the most almighty Christmas groove
I haven't had this much fun
Since ""Two little boys"" was number one
If my friends could see me now
How do I look?
Ridiculous
You little tease
A dance Kimberley?

I do love a nice sax break
Yeah me too Kim but let's wait till the record's over
Kim do you think our love will last forever?
No
Couple of years maybe?
No
Do you think we'll make it to the end of the record?
How long is that - exactly?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
All together now
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Excuse me can I sing something now?
Get lost Griff!
Well that's nice...

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Root beer anyone?
Later we'll have pumpkin pie
And we'll do some carolling
There's plenty of pumpkin pie left by the way
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Do you mind Melvyn?
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Wow yeah that was fantastic
Very nice
Let's do it again! One two three four...
Strewth
Five!

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
He overdid it with the pumpkin pie
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Merry Christmas everybody!
Merry Christmas everybody!
Bye Mel it's been really interesting
I'll tell you who I fancy for Christmas
Who's that

Yeah can't help you there I'm afraid
Oh thanks a bundle!

Miraklerne kommer når vi er klar
Klar til at glemme os selv
Drømmer vi nu eller glemmer vi blot at vi—

Sammen står vi stærkere når—

Viser vej

Og reder os fra undergang?

En julenat i indre by
Julesneen falder nu
Det sku' den helst ved juletid
En englesang med fryd derom
Jeg drømte mig en lille drøm

[Instrumental solo]

[Vers 2]
Der sker ting som ikk' sku' ske
Men er det sket så er det det
Er der noget du ikke fik gjort?
Så gør det nu livet er så kort
Og hvis du har et ønske i dit hjerte min ven
Ja så ønsk det nu for du ka' ikk' gå tilbage igen

[Omkvæd]
Drømte mig en drøm i nat
Om julesang og julepjat
Om engle falder ned fra sky
En julenat i indre by
Julesneen falder nu
Det sku' den helst ved juletid
En englesang med fryd derom
Jeg drømte mig en lille drøm

[Vers 3]
Er der noget du ikke fik gjort?
Så gør det nu
For livet er så kort
Der er så mange gaver
Der skal gi'es bort

[Omkvæd]
Julesneen falder ned (er der noget)
Det sku' den helst ved juletid (du ikk' fik gjort?)
Engelsang med fryd derom (ikk' fik gjort?)
Jeg drømte mig en lille drøm

[Omkvæd]
Drømte mig en drøm i nat
Om julesang og julepjat
Om engle falder ned fra sky

På julemænd og på damer
Og vinden fyger uendelig storm
Af tilbud og reklamer
Guirlander og blålys og bjælder
Og lys i barnlige øjne
Og Fanden selv står i TV og sælger
De sidste nye løgne

Og de synger i radio'n ved fem-tid'n
En lille sang om et håb
Der rækker helt fra Herodes til fremtid'n
Et kærlighedens råb
Et fremmed barn alene i mørket
Et fremmed land uden lys
Så rækker du din hånd ud af mørket
Og pluds'lig er der lys

Når julen er forbi
Og et nyt år er på vej
Vil vi prøve at nå
Det vi drømte om i år
Og vi lover hinanden
For en aller sidste gang
At huske at leve og bruge hvert sekundt vi får
Nu da den første sne
Igen
Er væk
Er det mer' på vej
Meget snart
Den smelted' i takt med
Så meget andet
Når solen skinner
Bliver alting klar
Når julen er forbi
Og et nyt år på vej
Vil vi prøve at nå
Det vi drømte om i år
Og vi lover hinanden
For en aller sidste gang
At huske at leve og bruge hvert sekundt vi får
Blanke krystaller der
Hvor sneen den lå
Bringer minder frem
Mens hjerterne slår
Der' altid så meget
At lave om på
Men stjernen på himlen
Den består
Når julen er forbi
Og et nyt år på vej
Vil vi prøve at nå
Det vi drømte om i år
Og vi lover hinanden
For en aller sidste gang
At huske at leve og bruge hvert sekundt vi får
Bomberne finder vej
I dag
Og i nat
Mens vi tænder lys (mens vi tænder lys)
I mørket fordi (i mørket fordi)
Vi håber og tror på
Et nyt år tusind
Hvor mennesker lever
Helt uden krig
Når julen er forbi
Og et nyt år på vej
Vil vi prøve at nå
Det vi drømte om i år
Og vi lover hinanden
For en aller sidste gang
At huske at leve og bruge hvert sekundt vi får
Når julen er forbi

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Man it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh the fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

Nu' det jul nu' det jul
Alle nissebande-nisser er så spændte
På hvor mange pakker de ska' hente
Om pakken den er blød

[Omkvæd]
Højt oppe langt mod nord
Der hvor julemanden bor
Og kigger fra sit vinterskjul
Der står hans kane klar
Til den tur han ta'r
Så det ka bli' en dejlig jul

[Vers 2]
Men hva' nu men hva' nu
Hvis de ikke kom de pakker der sku' komme
Og hvis alle fadende var tomme hva' mon
Der så ku' være sket?
Er han træt? (Er han træt?) Har han grædt?
Er han svag og syg og smittet og forkølet?
Løber næsen ned i nisseøllet?
Eller har han det skidt?

[Omkvæd]
Højt oppe langt mod nord
Der hvor julemanden bor
Og kigger fra sit vinterskjul
Der står hans kane klar
Til den tur han ta'r
Så det ka bli' en dejlig jul

[Outro]
Nu' det jul igen (Nu' det jul igen)
Der står hans kane klar

[Intro]
Det skete i de dage i november engang
At de første kataloger satte hyggen i gang

[Vers 1]
Det' jul det' cool det' nu man hygger sig bedst
Det' julebal i Nisseland familiernes fest
Med fornøjet glimt i øjet trækker folk i vintertøjet
Til den årlige folkevandring op og ned ad Strøget
Der bli'r handlet pakket ind og der bli'r købt og solgt
Tøsne snot i næsen det' pisse koldt
Det er vinter man forventer vel lidt kulde og sne
Men det' da klart at en såd'n sag må komme bag på DSB
Intet vrøvl har de forsvoret det de helt sikre på
Men ved den første rim på sporet går møllen i stå
Folk de tripper skælder ud og ser på deres ure
Og sparker efter invalide ynkelige duer
Der er intet man kan gøre de sure buschauffører
Gør det svært at praktisere lidt julehumør
""Gå så tilbage for helvede"" råber stodderen hæst
Men det' jul det' cool det nu man hygger sig bedst

[Instrumentalt omkvæd]

[Vers 2]
Det' jul det' cool gran og lirekasser
Der er mænd der sælger juletræer på alle åbne pladser
12 bevægelige nisser og en sort mekanisk kat
I et vindue ud mod Strøget trækker flere tusind watt
Kulørte gavepakker i kulørte juleposer
Selv i Bilka og i Irma og i alle landets brugser
Er der ægte julestemning og gratis brune kager
Der er hylder fyldt med hygge der er hygge på lager
Og hoes damerne i Illum kan man få det som man vil
""Kontant eller på konto hr.? Ska' prisen dækkes til?""
De smiler og er flinke mest for fruerne i minke
Og gi'r gode råd om alt fra sexet undertøj til sminke
Og vi andre fattigrøve vi ka' gå i Dalle-Valle
Der er damerne så flinke at de smiler pænt til alle
Der er masser tøj i kasser der helt sikkert passer
Det' jul det' cool gran og lirekasser

[Instrumentalt omkvæd]

[Vers 3]
Det' jul det' cool kig dig lidt omkring
15.000 mennesker i Magasin
De har våde lædersko de har halstørklæder på
De har overfrakker gavepakker masser de ska' nå
Men de hygger sig sel'fø'lig gør de det
Plastik stjerner plastik gran og plastik sne
Sætter stemning i systemer det' så nemt og nul problemer
Køb blot julestuens julesæt med fire fine cremer
Eller sukkerkrukker pyntedukker pænt mondænt og ganske smukt
Søde sæt med proptrækker glas og øloplukker
Fra en skjult højttalerinstallation
""Et barn er født i Bethlehem"" i Hammondorgel-version
Vi' traditionsbundne folk i traditionernes land
Så vi hygger os li'så fint vi kan
Og særlig uundværlig det er Magasin
Det' jul det' cool kig dig lidt omkring

[Instrumentalt omkvæd]

[Mellemstykke]
""Højt fra træets grønne top""
""Mød julemanden klokken 13 15 og 17 på julestuen på 3. sal""
""Vores velassorterede vinafdeling kan tilbyde et komplet gløgg-sæt for kun 39.95""
""Lille Øyvind på fem år er blevet væk fra sin mor han kan afhentes i kundeservice""

[Vers 4]
""Jamen du godeste er det allerede...""
Jul det' cool sikke tiden den går
Der er intet lavet om siden sidste år
Det' de samme ting vi spiser det' de samme ting vi laver
De samme ting i TV de samme julegaver
Samme pengeproblemer det' dyrt og hårdt
Udelukkende overtrukne kontokort
Overflod og fråds med familie og med venner
Samvittigheden klares med en ulandskalender
Det' julefrokosttid traditionspilleri
Sprutkørsel utroskab og madsvineri
Vi har prøvet det før vi ved præcis hvad der sker
Slankekur i januar og alt det der
Det' et slid men der er lang tid til næste år
Det' jul det' cool sikke tiden den går

[Instrumentalt omkvæd]
""Jeg drømmer om en hvid sandstrand
Med palmetræer og sommervejr
Der vil jeg fejre julen
I swimmingpoolen
Langt væk fra sne og juletræer""

[Intro]
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""Let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day

[Bridge]
Oh a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Outro]
Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us (This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us  (So praise the lord)
And love may reign once more

[Vers 1: Stewart Stardust]
Nu' det jul igen og hvad rager det mig?
Mit liv er i sit efterår og der' et mavesår på vej
Min guldtand er knækket og så 'det ikke skide skægt
At skide når man har en hæmoride som et hønseæg
Og jeg har liggesår og podegra og nyresvigt
Gule tænder skrumpelever hjertefejl og ledgigt
Jeg har et mareridt om min hund Rollo der spø'r
En spillemand om den må få mig med i himlen når den dør

[Bro: Stewart Stardust]
Så hey Lillemor! (gå væk!) Har du nedtur? (gå væææk!)
Spild af tid så snup en stesolid
For problemer er der nok af hvor end man kigger hen
Men hvad rager det mig nu' det jul igen

[Omkvæd: Stewart Stardust]
Alt kan ske når det er jul
Og selvom vores sne er gul
Så' det her (hey) det' bedst at bo (hoo)
Nu er det jul på Vesterbro

Og selvom kærlighed er dyr
Så' det her (hey) det' bedst at bo (hoo)

[Vers 2: Danny]
Nu' det jul igen men det skider jeg da på
Min hue er så snavset at den selv kan gå
Og jeg skylder tusind kroner til en fyr der går med lædervest
Min krop er lige så plettet som min straffeattest
Går i fucking joggingsæt og jeg har sår på mine knoer
Når jeg ikke sidder inde bor jeg hoes min far og mor
Og det er vinter det forvirrer mig med al det der sne
Forleden dag forsøgte jeg at sniffe Frederiksberg Allé

[Bro: Danny]
Så hey moar! (gå væk!) Har du nedtur? (gå væææk!)
Spild af tid så snup en stesolid
For det' et hundeliv at leve som en hund eller al det der
Men det skider jeg da på for nu det' jul igen

Alt kan ske når det er jul

[Vers 3: Arne Nuggagren]
Nu' det jul igen og til hekkenfeldt med det
Der' ingen der gider smage på min hagenbutten/pfirsich te
Min 2cv har fået stjålet sine fælge
Og Lone skred i går med en fyr der hedder Helge
Så kan man vælge bare at svælge i sorg og være bitter
For der er størknet linsesuppe på min sweater
Og jeg knokler for kommunen selvom jeg næsten ingen gage får
Det eneste der kører for mig er mit pagehår

[Bro: Arne Nuggagren]
Så hey Vivian! (gå væk!) Har du nedtur? (gå væææk!)

A little girl made a great big wish
To feel the world full of happiness

At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness?

With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Get my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style

Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can know some happiness with me

I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow and
They believe again

Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all

[Verse 1]
It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can’t stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

With you shawty with you
With you shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

[Verse 2]
Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
Word on the street Santa's coming tonight
Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

There is something special
About this time of year
A Christmas feeling's everywhere

Yes it's Christmas time (oh Christmas time)

[Verse 1]
Christmas night another fight
Tears we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

[Refrain]
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Verse 2]
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

[Refrain]
Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Oh Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights keep shining on

What will your daddy do when he sees your mama kissing Santa Claus A-ha

[1.vers Rasmus Bjerg]
Der er sgu altid så mange problemer
Så snart vi snakker Jul og hvad vi vil
Det handler om forskellighed
Pigerne stresser rundt med gavesystemer de poster julemad på Instagram
Vi er mere til billiard og lidt Spotify med Wham
Det har så givet mig en ide vi holder julen hver for sig
Og så tager boisne sgu på drengetur med mig

[Omkvæd Rasmus Bjerg Citybois]
Vi ved præcis hvad det er der skal til
Vi gør nøjagtig alt det som vi vil
Vi nyder en six-pack imens vi hører Last Christmas (uh ja)
Ingen spil eller ku' kun det vi kan lide
Ingen snik snak spræden en skod energi
Det er så vigtigt at vi får en rigtig drenge jul

[2.vers Rasmus Bjerg]
Vi pjatter lidt og ser lidt Disney Sjov (kolon)
Og drikker shots med gløgg uden at spørge om lov
Vi slås med puder og hygger i kanen
Vi ser et blad med store nissemænd
Vi får ild i pejsen og hygger vi lidt igen
Der er så meget vi skal nå og vi kan vædde en million
På at det her bliver en juletradition

[Omkvæd Rasmus Bjerg Citybois]
Vi gør præcis lige det som vi vil
Vi spiser and uden tilbehør til
Vi går om træet imens vi synger Last Christmas (uh ja)
Vi deler gaver ud og hvem ved så kommer julemanden måske
Det er så vildt at vi nu har sådan en rigtig drengejul

[3.vers Thor]
Uh det er så Scarlet alt det her
Fri fra damejagt og julehysteri
Det er så mega pat og det er den sygeste ide
Det er som om vi før var blinde men vores drengejul får os til at se (uh ja)

[Omkvæd Rasmus Bjerg Citybois]
Vi ved præcis hvad det er der skal til
Vi klæder os ud og leger krybespil
Vi smutter mandler imens vi hører Last Christmas (uh ja)
Vi brænder nødder på et komfur og dypper kuglerne i lækker glasur
Det er så vigtig at det bliver en rigtig drengejul
Vi ved præcis hvad det er der skal til
Vi dyrker sekser i terningespil
Vi gnider øjne imens vi hører Last Christmas (uh ja)
Vi putter tæt det er drenge magi
Det er surt julen snart er forbi
Men næste år skal vi også have en rigtig drengejuuul (ja ja drengejul uh)

Her hos dig her hos dig
Tænker jeg så klart åh så klart åh så klart
Jeg' lidt for trist og lidt forladt
På en kold og mørk decembernat
Stjerner kigger ind mon de ser mon de ser
Tåren på min kind? Mon de ved hva’ det er der sker?
Hvem er fjende hvem er ven?
Og hvem ka' vise vejen hjem igen?
Ja hjem igen

[Omkvæd]
For sneen falder overalt
Men her hos dig er altid plads til mig
Jeg stoler blindt på dig
For jeg' en bonde i et kongespil
Hvor hjerterne er frosset til og jeg
Jeg stoler blindt på dig

[Vers 2]
Verden er så stor og hvem er jeg? Jeg’ bare mig
Jeg ved jo ikke spor men jeg vil og jeg tror jeg ka'
Finde gnisten indeni
Sætte alle julehjerter fri

Men her hos dig er altid plads til mig

En stjerne på himlen
Og flere og flere
I nat føder himlen
Med jordiske veer
I nat lover himlen
At den vil befri os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias

Maria skal føde
Sin glæde med smerte
Der banker et hjerte
Bag vinterens hjerte
Selv kulden og mørket
Har håb de vil gi os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias

Hun bærer på barnet
Nu føler hun veen
Et hjerte så trodsigt
Som spurvens i sneen
En krybbe til vugge
For den som skal fri os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias. (Lille Messias)

Og han som bær verden
Bar hun som var kvinde
Som æslet bar hende
Da tiden var inde
Fred lyder det råb
Som nu genlyder i os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias

I nat ruger himlen
På glæden og freden
Så varsomt i mørket
Som fuglen i reden
Og freden og glæden
Nu fødes de i os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias

I fødslen er glæden
Forbundet med smerten
Dog aldrig var glæden
Så hjemløs i verden
Men stalden og krybben
Er tegn som skal si' os
Maria fandt plads
Da hun fødte Messias

En plads mellem får
I en stald mellem stude
Hun fødte og svøbte
Den lille i klude
Og hyrdernes glæde
Var stor som Marias
Lys tændes i mørket
Nu fødtes Messias
Nu fødtes Messias
Nu fødtes Messias

En mørk og kold december aften
Vinden pev og sneen føg
Vi sad og hørte radio
En melodi en simpel sang
Historien om den der gang
To mus faldt ned i en spand med mælk
De skreg men der kom ingen hjælp
Og snart så var det jul

To trætte mus i en spand med mælk
De svømmede rundt så godt de ku'
Men håbet svandt - hva gør vi nu?
Den ene ville drukne sig
Men makkeren sagde nej nej nej
For håbet sejrer kun måske
Så længe vi leder efter det
Bliv ved at lede efter det

Så svømmede de som aldrig før
Og mælken blev til sidst til smør
Så kravlede de op på land
Stod frem og knugede hinanden
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul

Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!

[Verse 1]
I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus (kissing kissing Santa Claus)
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep

[Chorus]
Then I saw mommy tickle tickle (tickle tickle Santa Claus)
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

[Bridge]
He saw mommy kissing (kissing kissing Santa Claus)
I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
And I'm gonna tell my dad

[Verse 2]
Then I saw mommy tickle (tickle tickle Santa Claus)
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

[Bridge]
I did! I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
You gotta believe me! You just gotta believe me!
Come on fellas believe me!
You just gotta believe me! (I told you I told you)

This year to save me from tears

Once bitten and twice as shy
I kept my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me

With a note saying ""I love you"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
And if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

We waited all through the year
For the day to appear
When we could be together in harmony

You know the time will come
Peace on earth for everyone
And we can live forever in a world where we are free
Let it shine for you and me

There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday

To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

We're all as one tonight
Makes no difference if you're black or white
'cause we can sing together in harmony

I know it's not too late
The world would be a better place
If we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
Send a message loud and clear

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air - you know it's everywhere
There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas every day

To see the joy in the children's eyes

Tiden læger alle sår det mærker du når

Får vi altid hjertets svar?

Rockin' around the Christmas tree

Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing ""Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" We'll say ""No man""
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Over the ground lies the mantle of light
A heaven of diamond in the lovely night
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then give him a name and call him Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" And then we'll say ""No man""
But now you can do the job whenever you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream sittin' by the fire
To face unafraid all the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking walking in a winter wonderland

Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo-hoo
Come on it's lovely weather

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up it's grand
Just holding your hand

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like birds of a feather would be

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a Christmas party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop pop pop

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
As they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fires gloosy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says let it snow let it snow let it snow

Let it snow!

Oooooh wee goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says let it snow let it snow let it snow

I don't care!

The weather outside is frightful
But that fire is mmm-delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are way down low
So let it snow let it snow let it snow!

Let it snow!

When we finally say goodnight
How I'll hate going out in a storm
But if you'll only hold me yight
All the way home I'll be warm

You're a monster Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole

You're a vile one Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile Mr. Grinch
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile

You're a foul one Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk Mr. Grinch
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows and I quote:
""Stink. Stank. Stunk.""

[Verse 5]
You're a rotter Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment
Of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled-up knots

Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase

Come a little closer children I've got a story to tell
(oh gee)
It's about a man you've heard of and I knew him well
(How well?)

He was born on a cold winter's morning
And went on to gain great fame
But may I begin my story
And refer to him by name?
(Please do)

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul (ooooh)
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman made the children smile they say
And were they surprised when he rolled his eyes
And he came to life that day!

There must of been some magic
In that ol' silk cap they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal!
Were they surprised when he rolled his eyes and he came to life that day!

(But Uncle Jimmy you didn't finish your story.)
I know I just paused to catch my breath
(What happened to frosty when he came to life that day?)
Well he got in a lot of trouble you see?

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun before I melt away
(Where'd he go?)
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there and around the square
Sayin' ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler ""Stop!""

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry
I'll be back again someday!

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at that Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""You Hoo""
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go
Let's look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

In fields where they lay keeping their sheep

Peace on earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim christ is born in bethlehem""

What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste haste to bring him laud
The babe the son of Mary

Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian fear: for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
Nails spear shall pierce Him through
The Cross be borne for me for you;
Hail hail the Word made flesh
The Babe the Son of Mary

So bring him incense gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him
Raise raise the song on high
The Virgin sing her lullaby:
Joy joy for Christ is born
The Babe the Son of Mary

(Chorus)
Oh the rising of the sun and the running of the deer
The playing of the merry organ sweet singing in the choir

The holly bears a blossom as white as lily flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to be our sweet savior

(Chorus)
The holly bears a berry as red as any blood
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to do poor sinners good

(Chorus)
The holly bears a prickle as sharp as any thorn
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ on Christmas Day in the morn

(Chorus)
The holly bears a bark as bitter as any gall
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ for to redeem us all

This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby it's bad out there)
Say what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat your hair looks swell)
I ought to say ""No no no sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

The answer is no (But baby it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But baby you'd freeze out there)
Say lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

Peaked Billboard position #18 in 1943

One minute to midnight
One minute to go
One minute to say good-bye
Before we say hello

Let's start the new year right
Twelve o'clock tonight
When they dim the light
Let's begin

Kissing the old year out
Kissing the new year in

Let's watch the old year die
With a fond good-bye
And our hopes as high
As a kite

How can our love go wrong if
We start the new year right?

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Let's watch the old year die
With a fond good-bye
And our hopes as high
As a kite

How can our love go wrong if
We start the new year right?

[Chorus]
Oh little town of Bethlehem how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight

[Verse 1]
For Christ is born of Mary and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together proclaim thy holy birth
And praises sing to God the king and peace to men on earth

[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
""They've got cars big as bars they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
""I could have been someone""
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat off with my glove
Who needs an overcoat I'm burning with love

My heart's on fire and the fire gets higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I've got to go away (Baby I'm cool with that)

This evening has been (Been hoping you get home safe)

So very nice (I'm glad you had a real good time)

My mother will start to worry (Call her so she knows that you're coming)

Father will be pacing the floor (Better get your car a-humming)

So really I'd better scurry (No rush)

Should I use the front or back door? (Which one are you pulling towards more?)

The neighbors might think (That you're a real nice girl)

What is this drink? (Pomegranate La Croix)

I wish I knew how (Maybe I can help you out)

To break this spell (I don't know what you're talking about)

I ought to say no no no (you reserve the right to say no)

At least I'm gonna say that I tried (you reserve the right to say no)

I really can't stay (...Well you don't have to)

Baby it's cold outside

I've got to get home (Do you know how to get there from here)

Say where is my coat (I'll go and grab it my dear)

You've really been grand (We'll have to do this again)

Yes I agree (How 'bout the Cheesecake Factory?)

We're bound to be talking tomorrow (Text me at your earliest convenience)

At least I have been getting that vibe (Unless I catch pneumonia and die)

I'll be on my way (Thanks for the great night)

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees O hear the angels voices
O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night O night divine

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friend

He knows our need to our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

His power and glory evermore proclaim

In three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours
The same thing too
The same thing too
The same thing too
Me and you
The same thing too

Away in a manger no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head

The cattle are lowing the poor baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes
I love Thee Lord Jesus look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh

Come and save my soul

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears

Jack Frost nipping on your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way;
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gone spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
For kids from one to ninety-two

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart

I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry - Beautiful what's your hurry?
Father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful please don't hurry
Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think - Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell - I'll take your hat your hair looks swell

I ought to say no no no sir - Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Ah but it's cold outside

I simply must go - But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no - But baby it's cold outside
This welcome has been - How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm - Look out that window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious - God your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon the tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Ooh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more - Never such a blizzard before

I got to get home - But baby you'd freeze out there
Say lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - I thrill when you touch my hand
Why don't you see - How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that hold out
Ah but it's cold outside
Oh baby it's cold outside
Oh baby it's cold outside

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two

[Verse 1]
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
It's the time that every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer?
Does a ton-up on his sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Verse 2]
Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell you
That old songs are the best?
Then she's up and rock-'n'-rolling with the rest

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Sigue]
What will your daddy do when he sees your momma kissing Santa Claus?

[Verse 2]
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head then you've been slayed

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now

So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudy
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudy the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
That he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Thumpetty thump thump thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump over the hills of snow
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said ""Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin' ""Catch me if you can""
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
He only paused a moment
When he heard him holler ""Stop""
Because ol' Frosty the snowman he had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day I'll be back again some day
I'll be back again some day""

O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

The thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees oh hear the angel voices
O night divine O night when Christ was born

O night divine

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices

[Verse 1]
Stockings are hung with care
As children sleep with one eye open
Well now there's more than toys at stake
Cause I'm older now but not done hoping

[Verse 2]
The twinkling of the lights
The scent of candles fill the household
'Ol Saint Nick has taken flight
With a heart on board so please be careful

[Pre-Chorus]
Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Verse 3]
A tree that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but this evening can be a holy night
So cozy on up by the fireplace
And dim those Christmas lights

So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever

Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater
Walk proudly to the mistletoe tonight
I want something to last forever
So kiss me on this cold December Night

[Closing]
Call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours for the taking
Call it the season of giving

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know

You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

[Verse 1]
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
No I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
There's no sense in hanging stockings
There upon the fireplace
Cause Santa he won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day


[Hook]
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
Girl what can I do?
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

[Verse 2]
And all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really love
Won't you please bring my baby to me...

[Chorus]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
No I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own
More that you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...
Is you...

Blink a bright red and green

Hear the snow crunch

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the north pole to spend a holiday

I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me so

You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Then kids in Girl and Boyland will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Now Santa is a busy man He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh so

You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watched their flock by night
And see a bright new shining star
And hear a choir sing
The music seem to come from afar

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
And find no place to borne she child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Silent night holy night!
All is calm All is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so Tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight!
Glories stream from heaven afar;
Heavenly hosts sing Al-le-lu-ia!
Christ the Savior is born!
Christ the Savior is born!

Silent night holy night!
Wondrous star lend thy light!
With the angels let us sing
Alleluia to our King!
Christ the Savior is here
Jesus the Savior is here!

Silent night Holy night!
Son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth;
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Sing sweet and low a lullaby till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem
While wisemen follow through the dark a star that beckons them
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem

A little child shall lead them the prophets said of old
Through storm and tempest heed them until the bell is tolled
Sing sweet and low your lullaby till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem

Sing sweet and low your lullaby till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem

Years from now perhaps we'll see
See the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace live in peace again

Peace on earth can it be

Every child must be made aware
Every child must be made to care
Care enough for his fellow man
To give all the love that he can

I pray my wish will come true
For my child and your child too
He'll see the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace live in peace again

Peace on earth can it be

[Verse 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

[Hook 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Outro]
So it's Christmas once more

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born

Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day

Oh my Lord a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord and full of admiration (So praise the lord)

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

And so I'm offering this simple phrase

Santa baby slip a sable under the tree for me

Santa baby an out-of-space convertible too light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby and hurry down the chimney tonight

Next year I could be oh so good
If you'd check off my Christmas list

[Verse 1]
Hello Dan it's Joe here
I hope you're keeping well
It's the 21st of December
And now they're ringing the last bells
If I get good behaviour
I'll be out of here by July
Won't you kiss my kids on Christmas Day?
Please don't let 'em cry for me

[Verse 2]
I guess the brothers are driving down from Queensland
And Stella's flying in from the coast
They say it's gonna be a hundred degrees even more maybe
But that won't stop the roast
Who's gonna make the gravy now?
I bet it won't taste the same
Just add flour salt a little red wine
And don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce
For sweetness and that extra tang

[Chorus 1]
And give my love to Angus and to Frank and Dolly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry I screwed up this time
And look after Rita I'll be thinking of her
Early Christmas morning when I'm standing in line

[Verse 3]
I hear Mary's got a new boyfriend
I hope he can hold his own
Do you remember the last one? What was his name again?
Ahh just a little too much cologne
And Roger you know I'm even gonna miss Roger
'Cause there's sure as hell no one in here I want to fight

[Chorus 2]
Oh praise the Baby Jesus have a Merry Christmas
I'm really gonna miss it all the treasure and the trash
And later in the evening I can just imagine
You'll put on Junior Murvin and push the tables back

[Chorus 3]
And you'll dance with Rita I know you really like her
Just don't hold her too close
Oh brother please don't stab me in the back
I didn't mean to say that it's just my mind it plays up
Multiplies each matter turns imagination into fact

[Chorus 4]
You know I love her badly she's the one to save me
I'm gonna make some gravy I'm gonna taste the fat
Ahh tell her that I'm sorry yeah I love her badly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry and kiss the sleepy children for me
You know one of these days I'll be making gravy
I'll be making plenty I'm gonna pay 'em all back

[Outro]
Yeah do-do-do-do do-do

Our newborn King to see

To lay before the King

Baby Jesus I am a poor boy too

But may I play for You
On my drum?

I played my best for Him

Christmas night another fight
Tears we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Verse 2]
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall

Down where the sea and city meet

Soon there'll be toys for good girls and boys
And reindeer are heading our way
Yes and Santa will come down the chimney above
There's one thing I wanted to say

I wish every day could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish every day could be full of peace and harmony
I wish every day could be like Christmas I do

Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earth was

That it's the greatest gift what you could give every day

I think I saw ol' Santa through my window Christmas eve
My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe
It must've been ol' Santa 'cause I saw his big red hat
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that Oh no
I know my Mom and Dad can't fly like that

And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door
The same ol' Christmas trick my dad had played since I was four
He stands outside my bedroom yelling 'Ho! Ho! Ho!' because
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus no way
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus

I think my daddy sees me
Peeking from my door
But he pretends he's Santa anyway
Every year he tries to fool me
But I'm a big boy now I don't believe in Santa or his sleigh...
No way!

So I went back to my bed and I curled up nice and tight
I stared out of my window and I looked into the night
And then all of a sudden through my window I could see
Santa Claus was flying by and smiling at me

Chorus:
Santa Claus Santa Claus
It must've been ol' Santa Claus
Santa Claus Santa Claus
Happy 'Ho! Ho! Ho!' to you

Then I heard ol' Rudolph tellin' me to come outside
He told me that ol' Santa wanted me to take a ride
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh
And then ol' Santa took me up and away
Santa took me up up and away

We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said
'Little boys like you should be in bed'

So I hollered 'Ho! Ho! Ho!'
And I put on Santa's hat
Then he let me hold the reins a while
We pulled up to my window
And I jumped back in my room
And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile

When I woke up Christmas morning (well) it was clear and bright
My parents said my window had blown open in the night
I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat
And they asked me where I got my big red hat Yeah yeah
They asked me where I got my big red hat

Chorus

Happy Ho! Ho! Ho! to you! (18x)

You were pretty Queen of New York City

We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

Verse 1:
The cold wind is blowin' and the streets are getting dark
I'm writin' you a letter and I don't know where to start
The bells will be ringin' Saint John the Divine
I get a little lonely every year around this time
The music plays all night in Little Italy
The lights will be going up on old Rockefeller tree
People window shopping on Fifth Avenue
All I want for Christmas is you

Chorus:
I've got to know (Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Where do the lonely hearts go(Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Oh cause' nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas

Verse 2:
Things are different since you've been here last
Childhood dreaming is a thing of the past
Maybe you can bring us some hope this year
Visions of sugar plums have disappeared
Do you remember sleigh riding in the snow
And dancing all night to ""Baby Please Come Home""
Today's celebration is bittersweet
There's mothers and children in the street

Chorus:
I wanna know (Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go (Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Cause' nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas

Verse 3:
I'm all grown up but I'm the same you'll see
I'm writing you this letter cause I still believe
Dear Santa I've been good this year
Can't you stay a little while with me right here

Ooooooh
I've got to know

Saxophone Instrumental

(Tell me) I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go

Oooooh Because nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas
Oooh nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas
Oooohhh nobody ought to be
Oooh yeah on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
All alone on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Tell me I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Don't leave me alone (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
All alone  on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Tell me I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Where do they all go (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Nobody on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)

With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh I wanna have him beside me like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th by that fireplace oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh baby
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
If he will be if he will be here
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
Oh woah

[Chorus]
Santa tell me (Santa tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me boy)

Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be if he won't be here)

'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

[Hook 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Outro]
So it's Christmas once more

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Man it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh the fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing

[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Oh mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
But baby don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no no no
Aw baby it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see no no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!

And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

Join in any reindeer games

Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

As they shouted out with glee

My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else

Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Takes me back to that little farm

You remind me of home

And pretend that he is Circus Clown
We’ll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

When it snows ain’t it thrillin'
Though your nose get’s a chillin'
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

[Outro]
Walkin’ in a winter wonderland
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know

How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say

He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day

So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Dashing through the snow (Rudolph)
In a one-horse open sleigh (today)
O'er the fields we go (Rudolph)
Laughing all the way (today)

Bells on bob-tail ring
Making our spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells jingle-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

I love those JINGLE bells
Those holiday JINGLE bells
All those happy JINGLE BE double LLES

In a one-horse open sleigh O
Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead

Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 2]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Bridge]
Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more nights on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep

Shake up the happiness

There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world
Before I get too old
And don't remember it
So let's december it
And reassemble it (oh yeah)

Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To feel the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

Chorus:
Shake it up

Verse:
At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness?

With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Get my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style

Pre-Chorus:
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can know some happiness with me

Shake it up

Wake up the happiness
Come on you all

Bridge:
I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow and
They believe again

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all

Christmas coming around again eh?
Yeah I mean it must be nearly a year since the last one
Oh it's a good twelve months
Yeah yeah
You getting anything for your Granny this year?
Well I thought about it I couldn't be bothered
Well it's the thought that counts innit
Yeah that's how I see it
What do you fancy for Christmas then
Kim Wilde as usual kidding myself though arent't I
It's hopeless really it's pathetic I suppose in a way
It is yeah - hello who is this?
Merry Christmas Melvyn
It can't be
Come on Mel how about pulling a cracker
By the look of you darling I think I already have
Get it

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple try to stop
Come on Melly-pops

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
Pumpkin pie anyone?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
This is so corny
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Wow I am in the most almighty Christmas groove
I haven't had this much fun
Since ""Two little boys"" was number one
If my friends could see me now
How do I look?
Ridiculous
You little tease
A dance Kimberley?

I do love a nice sax break
Yeah me too Kim but let's wait till the record's over
Kim do you think our love will last forever?
No
Couple of years maybe?
No
Do you think we'll make it to the end of the record?
How long is that - exactly?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
All together now
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Excuse me can I sing something now?
Get lost Griff!
Well that's nice...

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Root beer anyone?
Later we'll have pumpkin pie
And we'll do some carolling
There's plenty of pumpkin pie left by the way
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Do you mind Melvyn?
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Wow yeah that was fantastic
Very nice
Let's do it again! One two three four...
Strewth
Five!

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
He overdid it with the pumpkin pie
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Merry Christmas everybody!
Merry Christmas everybody!
Bye Mel it's been really interesting
I'll tell you who I fancy for Christmas
Who's that
Bananarama
Yeah can't help you there I'm afraid
Oh thanks a bundle!

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice as shy
I kept my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me

[Verse 2]
""Merry Christmas"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
And if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 3]
A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Tell me where did we go wrong?
We should be singing Christmas songs
Instead of shouting all night long like we do
We keep fighting in the street
When we should be home wrapped in the sheets
Putting presents underneath the tree for me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we had our fair share
Of breaking up and making up
I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up no

[Chorus]
If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll be together
Baby all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

[Verse 2]
It hasn't been the greatest year
But through thick and thin we made it here
Just keep holding onto me and I'll hold you
But we made it through the hardest part
And I followed you the brightest star
I just wanna be where you are right where you are

I want to thank the storm that brought the snow
Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow

We’re going to be a classic for all time
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe that this is happening

Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Thought I was done for thought that love had died
But you came along I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you baby
'Cause you make it feel like Christmas

Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

Take peppermint canes out the cupboard
Up to the attic a box full of lights

Might be here for a little bit but darling
If it's with you it’s okay with me

In the drunk tank

And dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one

This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas

I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City

They howled out for more

All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

Were singing 'Galway Bay'

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""Let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day

[Bridge]
Oh a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Outro]
Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

[Verse 1]
Feigning joy and surprise at the gifts we despise
Over mulled wine with you
On the 25th day of the 12th month
The sleigh bells are in time ringing true

[Pre-Chorus]
How we cling each noel to that snowflake's hope in hell
That it won't end

[Chorus]
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time
Just let them ring peace

[Verse 2]
Well the weather is cruel
And the season of yule warms the heart
But it still hurts
You've got your career
Spend the best part of last year apart
And it still hurts

[Pre-Chorus]
So that's why I pray each and every Christmas day
That it won't end

[Chorus]
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time
Just let them ring peace

(Christmas time)
(Don't let the bells end)
(Christmas time)
(Don't let the bells end)

[Bridge]
Poised underneath the mistletoe leaf
And you're not here
You went away upon boxing day
Now how the hell am I going to make it into the new year?

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Christmas time
Don't let the bells end (Don't let it end)
Christmas time
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time

Don't let the bells end (bells end)

Ah aha
Ooh ohh

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me

[Verse 2]
(Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special oh)
Oh oh baby

[Verse 3]
A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year to save me from tears (Ohh)
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Outro]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone I'll give it to someone special
Special...

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Tou better watch out better not cry you better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes. he comes
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes. he comes
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for everyone's Christmas joys
Tito had just one desire
That he gets a new guitar
But he wants a guarantee
That it won't play out of key
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Up on the housetop click click click
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
O
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me
Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep
Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
We wish you a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmaswe wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy new year
The jackson 5 wanna wish everyboy a merry merry christmas and a groovy new year
The jackson 5 wanna wish everyboy a merry merry christmas and a groovy new year
We wish you a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmaswe wish you a merry Christmas

[Verse 1]
Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 2]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Bridge]
Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more nights on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep

Tonight I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know

A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

""Bah humbug!"" No that's too strong
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy

To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from

Last year ski shop
Encounter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines

So deck those halls trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!

Flashback to springtime saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried we said we'd keep in touch

Didn't of course 'til summertime
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree

Now the calendar's just one page
And of course I am excited
Tonight's the night but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Hardly dashing through the snow
Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-do's
A few cards a few calls
'Cause it's r-s-v-p
No thanks no party lights
It's Christmas Eve gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites

Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go

Forget it it's cold it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?

So on with the boots back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!

""I'm spending this one alone"" he said
""Need a break; this year's been crazy.""
I said ""Me too but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?""

Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending! ""

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!

Are you hanging up your stocking on the wall?
Is it time that every Santa has a ball?
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer?
Does he tug upon a sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best?
And she's up and rock n rolling with the rest
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now it's only just begun
What will your daddy do
When he sees your mamma kissing Santa Claus?
Ahhh ahhh
Ahhh ahhh
Are you hinging up your socking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you rattle down the hillside
In the buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head then you will say
So here it is Merry Christmas

Look to the future now

So here it is Merry Christmas

And that's what I want (That's what I want)
So baby baby come and save me
Don't need those other numbers when I got my number one

Last night I lay in bed so blue
Cause I realized the truth they can't love me like you
I've tried to find somebody new
Baby they ain't got a clue can't love me like you

When I was a child I used to wonder
How Santa put my toys under the tree
I said ""Momma can you tell me how this can be?""
When there ain't no chimneys in the projects?
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the ghetto
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)

Momma sat me down and said ""Baby
Santa Clause does magic things
As soon as you're asleep a chimney will appear
And in the morning you will see all he brings
Don't you worry that their ain't no chimney's in the projects""
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the ghetto
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the projects

Now I'm all grown and I see
It was the ? that got that magic dime
But Momma now I know that you were the one
There ain't no chimneys in the projects
Not in the ghetto
Ain't no chimneys in the projects

Momma was the one
It was Momma Momma Momma

I gave you my heart
Merry Christmas

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
It's been a year you know it doesn't surprise me
Merry Christmas I wrapped it up and sent it
Merry Christmas I love you and I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

[Verse 2]
A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

Jimmy I just came back from a lovely trip along the milky way
I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday
I called on old dear Santa Claus to see what I could see
He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me
Now Santa is a busy man he has no time for play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You better write your letter now and mail it right away
Because he's getting ready his reindeers and his sleigh

[Chorus]
You'd better watch out you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list he's checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out whose naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 1]
He sees when you are sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
Oh you'd better watch out you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too -

[Chorus]
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 2]
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toyland all around the Christmas tree

So! You better watch out you better not cry

It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

""They've got cars big as bars they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out

When I first found you
I kept them with me babe

I've built my dreams around you

Now winter's on its way

Wish my heart could change like the seasons

As I've no festive cheer

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh I wanna have him beside me like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th by that fireplace oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh baby
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
If he will be if he will be here
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
Oh woah

[Chorus]
Santa tell me (Santa tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be if he won't be here)
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
It’s the most beautiful time of the year

With you shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July

Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say Hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh ho the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

Every single kiss is like a gift to me

Tonight I'm gonna hold you close

With no worries at all

Every year around this time I start to think about you
We're really gonna have another Christmas Eve without you
I can't believe it's been so long
Everyday finds a way to make me think about you
Like today when we were picking out the tree without you
I can't believe it's been so long

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh we miss you like hell all the stories that you'd tell
'Bout the boat that you built but never got to sail
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here we would

[Chorus]
Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here

[Verse 2]
Another year has passed and now it's time for buying the presents
I even got you one forgetting you're not gonna get it
I can't believe it's been so long
This time around we'll try to smile 'cause we're sick of tears
Most days are easy now but it gets hard this time of year
I can't believe you're really gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh we miss you like hell all the stories that you'd tell
'Bout the boat that you built but never got to sail
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here we would

[Chorus]
Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still
Wild and free I've got so many memories
Soon time too will take it all of 'em from me
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here

Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em

I really can't stay (Baby it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But I can call you a ride)
This evening has been (I'm so glad that you dropped in)
So very nice (Time spent with you is paradise)
My momma will start to worry (I'll call the car and tell him to hurry)
My daddy will be pacing the floor (Wait what are you still livin' home for?)
So really I'd better scurry (Your driver his name is Murray)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Oh we're both adults so who's keepin' score?)
What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice)
If I have one more drink? (It's your body and your choice)
Ooh you really know how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To cast a spell (One look at you and then I fell)
I ought to say ""No no no sir"" (Then you really ought to go go go)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (Well Murray he just pulled up outside)

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson John Legend & Both]
Oh I really can't stay
(I understand baby)
Baby it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson & John Legend]
I simply should go (Text me when you get home)
Oh I'm supposed to say no (Mm I guess that's respectable)
This welcome has been (I've been lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (But you better go before it storms)
My sister will be suspicious (Well gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Oh he loves my music baby I'm sure)
My gossipy neighbor is vicious (I'm a genie tell me what your wish is)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Oh that's somethin' we should probably explore)
I've got to get home (Oh baby I'm well aware)
Say lend me a coat (Oh keep it girl I don't care)
You've really been grand (I feel it when you touch my hands)
But don't you see? (I want you to stay it's not up to me)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Well they can talk but what do they know?)
At least there will be plenty implied (Oh let them mind their business and go-)
Uh ma'am I really can't stay

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson & Both]
Baby just go
It's cold baby
It's cold baby
But ooh I don't wanna go
It's cold outside

My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby yeah

And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh baby baby Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby baby Merry Christmas (To you)

Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me ""I love you""

Can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas

[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'll say to Dad when he sees the empty chair
Don't want to hear my mom say ""Told you so""
Waiting for Santa in my bed is no fun if you're not there
And I don't want to be angry at mistletoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Please can we make it to Christmas?
Can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas

[Bridge]
Darling I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Break my heart on Boxing Day
Just please can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas (Yeah)
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?

I want to thank the storm that brought the snow
Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow

It barely took a breath to realize
We’re going to be a classic for all time
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Thought I was done for thought that love had died
But you came along I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you baby
'Cause you make it feel like Christmas

I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Be merry and bright

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

I’ve heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord

Well it goes like this
The fourth the fifth the minor fall the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

[Verse 2: Avi]
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

[Verse 3: Kirstin]
Well baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a vict'ry march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

[Verse 4: Mitch]
Well maybe there’s a God above
But all I’ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it’s not a cry that you hear at night
It’s not somebody who's seen the light
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah

Was watching the snow fall
When you called to say we were through
Now whenever I hear those Christmas songs I just cry loud
So no I'm not giving your presents to somebody new

'Cause right now that don't mean nothing to me
Why can't December just be over real real soon?
Because Christmas isn't Christmas without you

I can fake it but they said good Saint Nick is honest to me
No lying I swear I've been so good all year what the fuck? (I'm not lying; swear)

Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home

And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
We're walking in a winter wonderland

And gone away (gone away) is the bluebird (is the bluebird)
But here to stay stay stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
We're walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on (later on! ) we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire babe
We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

And later on (later on! ) we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland

We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland

We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland
(Walking in a winter wonderland.)

[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Oh mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
But baby don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no no no
Aw baby it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see no no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!

We waited all through the year
For the day to appear
When we could be together in harmony

You know the time will come
Peace on earth for everyone
And we can live forever in a world where we are free
Let it shine for you and me

There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday

To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

We're all as one tonight
Makes no difference if you're black or white
'cause we can sing together in harmony

I know it's not too late
The world would be a better place
If we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
Send a message loud and clear

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air - you know it's everywhere
There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas every day

And I wanna tell the world before I get too old
And don't remember it so let's December it

Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above

Can you send some happiness
With my best to the rest of the people
Of the east and the west?
And maybe every once in a while
Give my grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season of smile

It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
Let me meet a boy one day
That wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness
Come on y'all it's Christmas time

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness

Do you hear what I hear
A song a song high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace warm mighty king
Do you know what I know
A child a child shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say
A child a child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light

On your own front door

And the thing that'll make them ring is the carol that you'll sing

I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night

[Chorus]
Ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night

[Verse 2]
Oh Santa
I heard that it's really gonna snow this year
So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really really really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
’Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on oh Kris Kringle send me help

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night?

[Chorus]
Ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night

[Post-Chorus]
Oh Santa
Oh Santa
Oh Santa
Come on Santa

[Refrain]
Oh Santa
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come and make him mine mine
Oh Santa
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come and make him mine mine

[Verse 3]
Oh Santa Claus
If you get this letter please don't make me wait
'Cause all December I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies

[Pre-Chorus 3]
The trees all sparkly and gold
But inside I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas?

[Chorus]
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine mine
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine mine
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho ho ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho ho ho

[Verse 1]
Stockings are hung with care
As children sleep with one eye open
Well now there's more than toys at stake
Cause I'm older now but not done hoping

[Verse 2]
The twinkling of the lights
The scent of candles fill the household
'Ol Saint Nick has taken flight
With a heart on board so please be careful

[Pre-Chorus]
Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Verse 3]
A tree that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but this evening can be a holy night
So cozy on up by the fireplace
And dim those Christmas lights

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Bridge]
They call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours

[Chorus]
Just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater
Walk proudly to the mistletoe tonight
I want something to last forever
So kiss me on this cold December Night

[Closing]
Call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours for the taking
Call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm

Winter's on the wind
Sings familiar melodies
Chill starts setting in
Silver bells are casting spells
It all comes back again
Lay your troubles down
Let me hold you

Now all the signs appear
The Christmas trees the memories
They bring this time of year
Ghosts of winters past
Come in and whisper in your ear
Don't listen to a word they've told you

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm
Start a fire and feel it glow
As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
You don't have to face the cold alone no more
I'll keep you warm

It's only you and me
The world outside is frozen white
I know it's hard to see
I'll be your candle
Be your light
Be anything you need
Star above the night to guide you

To find the highest bow
Hang up your regrets and
Let them fade into the sound
The angel choirs and roaring fires
Magic lost and found
Love is all around
Let it find you

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm
Start a fire and feel it glow
As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
You don't have to face the cold alone no more
I'll keep you warm

Through the frightful weather
I will hold you tight
We'll stay warm together
This December night
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm

As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
Now I know you've faced the cold alone before
But you don't have to face the cold alone no more
Because I'll keep you warm...

Classical Christmas,Anonymous,Ding Dong! Merrily on High,https://open.spotify.com/track/5deugvvBm2rJBPI2S0BZmQ,0.318,0.253,-20.4,0.385,80.903,"

The poem of which the following pages offer a prose rendering is contained in a MS. believed to be unique of the Cottonian Collection Nero A.X. preserved in the British Museum. The MS. is of the end of the fourteenth century but it is possible that the composition of the poem is somewhat earlier; the subject-matter is certainly of very old date. There has been a considerable divergence of opinion among scholars on the question of authorship but the view now generally accepted is that it is the work of the same hand as Pearl another poem of considerable merit contained in the same MS.
Our poem or to speak more correctly metrical romance contains over 2500 lines and is composed in staves of varying length ending in five short rhyming lines technically known as a bob and a wheel–the lines forming the body of the stave being not rhyming but alliterative. The dialect in which it is written has been decided to be West Midland probably Lancashire and is by no means easy to understand. Indeed it is the real difficulty and obscurity of the language which in spite of careful and scholarly editing will always place the poem in its original form outside the range of any but professed students of mediæval literature which has encouraged me to make an attempt to render it more accessible to the general public by giving it a form that shall be easily intelligible and at the same time preserve as closely as possible the style of the author.
For that style in spite of a certain roughness unavoidable at a period in which the language was still in a partially developed and amorphous stage is really charming. The author has a keen eye for effect; a talent for description detailed without becoming wearisome; a genuine love of Nature and sympathy with her varying moods; and a real refinement and elevation of feeling which enable him to deal with a risqué: situation with an absence of coarseness not unfortunately to be always met with in a mediæval writer. Standards of taste vary with the age but even judged by that of our own day the author of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight comes not all too badly out of the ordeal!
The story with which the poem deals too has claims upon our interest. I have shown elsewhere 1 that the beheading challenge is an incident of very early occurrence in heroic legend and that the particular form given to it in the English poem is especially interesting corresponding as it does to the variations of the story as preserved in the oldest known version that of the old Irish Fled Bricrend.
But in no other version is the incident coupled with that of a temptation and testing of the hero's honour and chastity such as meets us here. At first sight one is inclined to assign the episode of the lady of the castle to the class of stories of which the oldest version is preserved in Biblical record–the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife; a motif not unseldom employed by mediæval writers and which notably occurs in what we may call the Launfal group of stories. But there are certain points which may make us hesitate as to whether in its first conception the tale was really one of this class.
It must be noted that here the lady is acting throughout with the knowledge and consent of the husband an important point of difference. In the second place it is very doubtful whether her entire attitude was not a ruse. From the Green Knight's words to Gawain when he finally reveals himself ""I wot we shall soon make peace with my wife who was thy bitter enemy"" her conduct hardly seems to have been prompted by real passion.
In my Studies on the Legend of Sir Gawain already referred to I have suggested that the character of the lady here is perhaps a reminiscence of that of the Queen of the Magic Castle or Isle daughter or niece of an enchanter who at an early stage of Gawain's story was undoubtedly his love. I think it not impossible that she was an integral part of the tale as first told and her rôle here was determined by that which she originally played. In most versions of the story she has dropped out altogether. It is of course possible that there being but a confused reminiscence of the original tale her share may have been modified by the influence of the Launfal group; but I should prefer to explain the episode on the whole as a somewhat distorted survival of an original feature.
But in any case we may be thankful for this that the author of the most important English metrical romance dealing with Arthurian legend faithfully adheres to the original conception of Gawain's character as drawn before the monkish lovers of edification laid their ruthless hands on his legend and turned the model of knightly virtues and courtesy into a mere vulgar libertine.
Brave chivalrous loyally faithful to his plighted word scrupulously heedful of his own and others' honour Gawain stands before us in this poem. We take up Malory or Tennyson and in spite of their charm of style in spite of the halo of religious mysticism in which they have striven to enwrap their characters we lay them down with a feeling of dissatisfaction. How did the Gawain of their imagination this empty-headed empty-hearted worldling cruel murderer and treacherous friend ever come to be the typical English hero? For such Gawain certainly was even more than Arthur himself. Then we turn back to these faded pages and read the quaintly earnest words in which the old writer reveals the hidden meaning of that mystic symbol the pentangle and vindicates Gawain's title to claim it as his badge–and we smile perhaps but we cease to wonder at the widespread popularity of King Arthur's famous nephew or at the immense body of romance that claims him as its hero.
Scholars know all this of course; they can read the poem for themselves in its original rough and intricate phraseology; perhaps they will be shocked at an attempt to handle it in simpler form. But this little book is not for them and if to those to whom the tale would otherwise be a sealed treasure these pages bring some new knowledge of the way in which our forefathers looked on the characters of the Arthurian legend the tales they told of them (unconsciously betraying the while how they themselves lived and thought and spoke)–if by that means they gain a keener appreciation of our national heroes a wider knowledge of our national literature–then the spirit of the long-dead poet will doubtless not be the slowest to pardon my handling of what was his masterpiece as it is in M. Gaston Paris' words ""The jewel of English mediæval literature.""

Preface to Second Edition

In preparing this Second Edition I have adopted certain suggestions of the late Professor Kölbing contained in a review published by him in Englische Studien xxvi. In one or two instances however I have not felt free to follow his reading–e.g. on page 67 in þrynne syþe must certainly mean ""for the third time"" not ""thrice."" The lady has already kissed Gawain twice during the interview; Professor Kölbing's suggestion would make him receive five kisses instead of three the correct number. Nor do I think the story would gain anything by reproducing the details of the dissection of animals on page 46. This little series is not intended for scholars who can study the original works for themselves but for the general public and I have therefore avoided any digression from the main thread of the story. In the main however I have gladly availed myself of the late Professor's learned criticisms.

Sir Gawain and the Green Knight
After the siege and the assault of Troy when that burg was destroyed and burnt to ashes and the traitor tried for his treason the noble Æneas and his kin sailed forth to become princes and patrons of well-nigh all the Western Isles. Thus Romulus built Rome (and gave to the city his own name which it bears even to this day); and Ticius turned him to Tuscany; and Langobard raised him up dwellings in Lombardy; and Felix Brutus sailed far over the French flood and founded the kingdom of Britain wherein have been war and waste and wonder and bliss and bale ofttimes since.
And in that kingdom of Britain have been wrought more gallant deeds than in any other; but of all British kings Arthur was the most valiant as I have heard tell therefore will I set forth a wondrous adventure that fell out in his time. And if ye will listen to me but for a little while I will tell it even as it stands in story stiff and strong fixed in the letter as it hath long been known in the land.
*****
King Arthur lay at Camelot upon a Christmas-tide with many a gallant lord and lovely lady and all the noble brotherhood of the Round Table. There they held rich revels with gay talk and jest; one while they would ride forth to joust and tourney and again back to the court to make carols; 2 for there was the feast holden fifteen days with all the mirth that men could devise song and glee glorious to hear in the daytime and dancing at night. Halls and chambers were crowded with noble guests the bravest of knights and the loveliest of ladies and Arthur himself was the comeliest king that ever held a court. For all this fair folk were in their youth the fairest and most fortunate under heaven and the king himself of such fame that it were hard now to name so valiant a hero.
Now the New Year had but newly come in and on that day a double portion was served on the high table to all the noble guests and thither came the king with all his knights when the service in the chapel had been sung to an end. And they greeted each other for the New Year and gave rich gifts the one to the other (and they that received them were not wroth that may ye well believe!) and the maidens laughed and made mirth till it was time to get them to meat. Then they washed and sat them down to the feast in fitting rank and order and Guinevere the queen gaily clad sat on the high daïs. Silken was her seat with a fair canopy over her head of rich tapestries of Tars embroidered and studded with costly gems; fair she was to look upon with her shining grey eyes a fairer woman might no man boast himself of having seen.
But Arthur would not eat till all were served so full of joy and gladness was he even as a child; he liked not either to lie long or to sit long at meat so worked upon him his young blood and his wild brain. And another custom he had also that came of his nobility that he would never eat upon an high day till he had been advised of some knightly deed or some strange and marvellous tale of his ancestors or of arms or of other ventures. Or till some stranger knight should seek of him leave to joust with one of the Round Table that they might set their lives in jeopardy one against another as fortune might favour them. Such was the king's custom when he sat in hall at each high feast with his noble knights therefore on that New Year tide he abode fair of face on the throne and made much mirth withal.
Thus the king sat before the high tables and spake of many things; and there good Sir Gawain was seated by Guinevere the queen and on her other side sat Agravain à la dure main; 3 both were the king's sister's sons and full gallant knights. And at the end of the table was Bishop Bawdewyn and Ywain King Urien's son sat at the other side alone. These were worthily served on the daïs and at the lower tables sat many valiant knights. Then they bare the first course with the blast of trumpets and waving of banners with the sound of drums and pipes of song and lute that many a heart was uplifted at the melody. Many were the dainties and rare the meats so great was the plenty they might scarce find room on the board to set on the dishes. Each helped himself as he liked best and to each two were twelve dishes with great plenty of beer and wine.
Now I will say no more of the service but that ye may know there was no lack for there drew near a venture that the folk might well have left their labour to gaze upon. As the sound of the music ceased and the first course had been fitly served there came in at the hall door one terrible to behold of stature greater than any on earth; from neck to loin so strong and thickly made and with limbs so long and so great that he seemed even as a giant. And yet he was but a man only the mightiest that might mount a steed; broad of chest and shoulders and slender of waist and all his features of like fashion; but men marvelled much at his colour for he rode even as a knight yet was green all over.
For he was clad all in green with a straight coat and a mantle above; all decked and lined with fur was the cloth and the hood that was thrown back from his locks and lay on his shoulders. Hose had he of the same green and spurs of bright gold with silken fastenings richly worked; and all his vesture was verily green. Around his waist and his saddle were bands with fair stones set upon silken work 'twere too long to tell of all the trifles that were embroidered thereon–birds and insects in gay gauds of green and gold. All the trappings of his steed were of metal of like enamel even the stirrups that he stood in stained of the same and stirrups and saddle-bow alike gleamed and shone with green stones. Even the steed on which he rode was of the same hue a green horse great and strong and hard to hold with broidered bridle meet for the rider.
The knight was thus gaily dressed in green his hair falling around his shoulders; on his breast hung a beard as thick and green as a bush and the beard and the hair of his head were clipped all round above his elbows. The lower part of his sleeves were fastened with clasps in the same wise as a king's mantle. The horse's mane was crisp and plaited with many a knot folded in with gold thread about the fair green here a twist of the hair here another of gold. The tail was twined in like manner and both were bound about with a band of bright green set with many a precious stone; then they were tied aloft in a cunning knot whereon rang many bells of burnished gold. Such a steed might no other ride nor had such ever been looked upon in that hall ere that time; and all who saw that knight spake and said that a man might scarce abide his stroke.
The knight bore no helm nor hauberk neither gorget nor breast-plate neither shaft nor buckler to smite nor to shield but in one hand he had a holly-bough that is greenest when the groves are bare and in his other an axe huge and uncomely a cruel weapon in fashion if one would picture it. The head was an ell-yard long the metal all of green steel and gold the blade burnished bright with a broad edge as well shapen to shear as a sharp razor. The steel was set into a strong staff all bound round with iron even to the end and engraved with green in cunning work. A lace was twined about it that looped at the head and all adown the handle it was clasped with tassels on buttons of bright green richly broidered.
The knight rideth through the entrance of the hall driving straight to the high daïs and greeted no man but looked ever upwards; and the first words he spake were ""Where is the ruler of this folk? I would gladly look upon that hero and have speech with him."" He cast his eyes on the knights and mustered them up and down striving ever to see who of them was of most renown.
Then was there great gazing to behold that chief for each man marvelled what it might mean that a knight and his steed should have even such a hue as the green grass; and that seemed even greener than green enamel on bright gold. All looked on him as he stood and drew near unto him wondering greatly what he might be; for many marvels had they seen but none such as this and phantasm and faërie did the folk deem it. Therefore were the gallant knights slow to answer and gazed astounded and sat stone still in a deep silence through that goodly hall as if a slumber were fallen upon them. I deem it was not all for doubt but some for courtesy that they might give ear unto his errand.
Then Arthur beheld this adventurer before his high daïs and knightly he greeted him for fearful was he never. ""Sir"" he said ""thou art welcome to this place–lord of this hall am I and men call me Arthur. Light thee down and tarry awhile and what thy will is that shall we learn after.""
""Nay"" quoth the stranger ""so help me He that sitteth on high 'twas not mine errand to tarry any while in this dwelling; but the praise of this thy folk and thy city is lifted up on high and thy warriors are holden for the best and the most valiant of those who ride mail-clad to the fight. The wisest and the worthiest of this world are they and well proven in all knightly sports. And here as I have heard tell is fairest courtesy therefore have I come hither as at this time. Ye may be sure by the branch that I bear here that I come in peace seeking no strife. For had I willed to journey in warlike guise I have at home both hauberk and helm shield and shining spear and other weapons to mine hand but since I seek no war my raiment is that of peace. But if thou be as bold as all men tell thou wilt freely grant me the boon I ask.""
And Arthur answered ""Sir Knight if thou cravest battle here thou shalt not fail for lack of a foe.""
And the knight answered ""Nay I ask no fight in faith here on the benches are but beardless children were I clad in armour on my steed there is no man here might match me. Therefore I ask in this court but a Christmas jest for that it is Yule-tide and New Year and there are here many fain for sport. If any one in this hall holds himself so hardy 4 so bold both of blood and brain as to dare strike me one stroke for another I will give him as a gift this axe which is heavy enough in sooth to handle as he may list and I will abide the first blow unarmed as I sit. If any knight be so bold as to prove my words let him come swiftly to me here and take this weapon I quit claim to it he may keep it as his own and I will abide his stroke firm on the floor. Then shalt thou give me the right to deal him another the respite of a year and a day shall he have. Now haste and let see whether any here dare say aught.""
Now if the knights had been astounded at the first yet stiller were they all high and low when they had heard his words. The knight on his steed straightened himself in the saddle and rolled his eyes fiercely round the hall red they gleamed under his green and bushy brows. He frowned and twisted his beard waiting to see who should rise and when none answered he cried aloud in mockery ""What is this Arthur's hall and these the knights whose renown hath run through many realms? Where are now your pride and your conquests your wrath and anger and mighty words? Now are the praise and the renown of the Round Table overthrown by one man's speech since all keep silence for dread ere ever they have seen a blow!""
With that he laughed so loudly that the blood rushed to the king's fair face for very shame; he waxed wroth as did all his knights and sprang to his feet and drew near to the stranger and said ""Now by heaven foolish is thy asking and thy folly shall find its fitting answer. I know no man aghast at thy great words. Give me here thine axe and I shall grant thee the boon thou hast asked."" Lightly he sprang to him and caught at his hand and the knight fierce of aspect lighted down from his charger.
Then Arthur took the axe and gripped the haft and swung it round ready to strike. And the knight stood before him taller by the head than any in the hall; he stood and stroked his beard and drew down his coat no more dismayed for the king's threats than if one had brought him a drink of wine.
Then Gawain who sat by the queen leaned forward to the king and spake ""I beseech ye my lord let this venture be mine. Would ye but bid me rise from this seat and stand by your side so that my liege lady thought it not ill then would I come to your counsel before this goodly court. For I think it not seemly when such challenges be made in your hall that ye yourself should undertake it while there are many bold knights who sit beside ye none are there methinks of readier will under heaven or more valiant in open field. I am the weakest I wot and the feeblest of wit and it will be the less loss of my life if ye seek sooth. For save that ye are mine uncle naught is there in me to praise no virtue is there in my body save your blood and since this challenge is such folly that it beseems ye not to take it and I have asked it from ye first let it fall to me and if I bear myself ungallantly then let all this court blame me.""
Then they all spake with one voice that the king should leave this venture and grant it to Gawain.
Then Arthur commanded the knight to rise and he rose up quickly and knelt down before the king and caught hold of the weapon; and the king loosed his hold of it and lifted up his hand and gave him his blessing and bade him be strong both of heart and hand. ""Keep thee well nephew"" quoth Arthur ""that thou give him but the one blow and if thou redest him rightly I trow thou shalt well abide the stroke he may give thee after.""
Gawain stepped to the stranger axe in hand and he never fearing awaited his coming. Then the Green Knight spake to Sir Gawain ""Make we our covenant ere we go further. First I ask thee knight what is thy name? Tell me truly that I may know thee.""
""In faith"" quoth the good knight ""Gawain am I who give thee this buffet let what may come of it; and at this time twelvemonth will I take another at thine hand with whatsoever weapon thou wilt and none other.""
Then the other answered again ""Sir Gawain so may I thrive as I am fain to take this buffet at thine hand"" and he quoth further ""Sir Gawain it liketh me well that I shall take at thy fist that which I have asked here and thou hast readily and truly rehearsed all the covenant that I asked of the king save that thou shalt swear me by thy troth to seek me thyself wherever thou hopest that I may be found and win thee such reward as thou dealest me to-day before this folk.""
""Where shall I seek thee?"" quoth Gawain. ""Where is thy place? By Him that made me I wot never where thou dwellest nor know I thee knight thy court nor thy name. But teach me truly all that pertaineth thereto and tell me thy name and I shall use all my wit to win my way thither and that I swear thee for sooth and by my sure troth.""
""That is enough in the New Year it needs no more"" quoth the Green Knight to the gallant Gawain ""if I tell thee truly when I have taken the blow and thou hast smitten me; then will I teach thee of my house and home and mine own name then mayest thou ask thy road and keep covenant. And if I waste no words then farest thou the better for thou canst dwell in thy land and seek no further. But take now thy toll and let see how thy strikest.""
""Gladly will I"" quoth Gawain handling his axe.
Then the Green Knight swiftly made him ready he bowed down his head and laid his long locks on the crown that his bare neck might be seen. Gawain gripped his axe and raised it on high the left foot he set forward on the floor and let the blow fall lightly on the bare neck. The sharp edge of the blade sundered the bones smote through the neck and clave it in two so that the edge of the steel bit on the ground and the fair head fell to the earth that many struck it with their feet as it rolled forth. The blood spurted forth and glistened on the green raiment but the knight neither faltered nor fell; he started forward with out-stretched hand and caught the head and lifted it up; then he turned to his steed and took hold of the bride set his foot in the stirrup and mounted. His head he held by the hair in his hand. Then he seated himself in his saddle as if naught ailed him and he were not headless. He turned his steed about the grim corpse bleeding freely the while and they who looked upon him doubted them much for the covenant.
For he held up the head in his hand and turned the face towards them that sat on the high daïs and it lifted up the eyelids and looked upon them and spake as ye shall hear. ""Look Gawain that thou art ready to go as thou hast promised and seek leally till thou find me even as thou hast sworn in this hall in the hearing of these knights. Come thou I charge thee to the Green Chapel such a stroke as thou hast dealt thou hast deserved and it shall be promptly paid thee on New Year's morn. Many men know me as the knight of the Green Chapel and if thou askest thou shalt not fail to find me. Therefore it behoves thee to come or to yield thee as recreant.""
With that he turned his bridle and galloped out at the hall door his head in his hands so that the sparks flew from beneath his horse's hoofs. Whither he went none knew no more than they wist whence he had come; and the king and Gawain they gazed and laughed for in sooth this had proved a greater marvel than any they had known aforetime.
Though Arthur the king was astonished at his heart yet he let no sign of it be seen but spake in courteous wise to the fair queen: ""Dear lady be not dismayed such craft is well suited to Christmas-tide when we seek jesting laughter and song and fair carols of knights and ladies. But now I may well get me to meat for I have seen a marvel I may not forget."" Then he looked on Sir Gawain and said gaily ""Now fair nephew hang up thine axe since it has hewn enough"" and they hung it on the dossal above the daïs where all men might look on it for a marvel and by its true token tell of the wonder. Then the twain sat them down together the king and the good knight and men served them with a double portion as was the share of the noblest with all manner of meat and of minstrelsy. And they spent that day in gladness but Sir Gawain must well bethink him of the heavy venture to which he had set his hand. *****
This beginning of adventures had Arthur at the New Year; for he yearned to hear gallant tales though his words were few when he sat at the feast. But now had they stern work on hand. Gawain was glad to begin the jest in the hall but ye need have no marvel if the end be heavy. For though a man be merry in mind when he has well drunk yet a year runs full swiftly and the beginning but rarely matches the end.
For Yule was now over-past5 and the year after each season in its turn following the other. For after Christmas comes crabbed Lent that will have fish for flesh and simpler cheer. But then the weather of the world chides with winter; the cold withdraws itself the clouds uplift and the rain falls in warm showers on the fair plains. Then the flowers come forth meadows and grove are clad in green the birds make ready to build and sing sweetly for solace of the soft summer that follows thereafter. The blossoms bud and blow in the hedgerows rich and rank and noble notes enough are heard in the fair woods.
After the season of summer with the soft winds when zephyr breathes lightly on seeds and herbs joyous indeed is the growth that waxes thereout when the dew drips from the leaves beneath the blissful glance of the bright sun. But then comes harvest and hardens the grain warning it to wax ripe ere the winter. The drought drives the dust on high flying over the face of the land; the angry wind of the welkin wrestles with the sun; the leaves fall from the trees and light upon the ground and all brown are the groves that but now were green and ripe is the fruit that once was flower. So the year passes into many yesterdays and winter comes again as it needs no sage to tell us.
When the Michaelmas moon was come in with warnings of winter Sir Gawain bethought him full oft of his perilous journey. Yet till All Hallows Day he lingered with Arthur and on that day they made a great feast for the hero's sake with much revel and richness of the Round Table. Courteous knights and comely ladies all were in sorrow for the love of that knight and though they spake no word of it many were joyless for his sake.
And after meat sadly Sir Gawain turned to his uncle and spake of his journey and said ""Liege lord of my life leave from you I crave. Ye know well how the matter stands without more words to-morrow am I bound to set forth in search of the Green Knight.""
Then came together all the noblest knights Ywain and Erec and many another. Sir Dodinel le Sauvage the Duke of Clarence Launcelot and Lionel and Lucan the Good Sir Bors and Sir Bedivere valiant knights both and many another hero with Sir Mador de la Porte and they all drew near heavy at heart to take counsel with Sir Gawain. Much sorrow and weeping was there in the hall to think that so worthy a knight as Gawain should wend his way to seek a deadly blow and should no more wield his sword in fight. But the knight made ever good cheer and said ""Nay wherefore should I shrink? What may a man do but prove his fate?""
He dwelt there all that day and on the morn he arose and asked betimes for his armour; and they brought it unto him on this wise: first a rich carpet was stretched on the floor6 (and brightly did the gold gear glitter upon it) then the knight stepped on to it and handled the steel; clad he was in a doublet of silk with a close hood lined fairly throughout. Then they set the steel shoes upon his feet and wrapped his legs with greaves with polished knee-caps fastened with knots of gold. Then they cased his thighs in cuisses closed with thongs and brought him the byrny of bright steel rings sewn upon a fair stuff. Well burnished braces they set on each arm with good elbow-pieces and gloves of mail and all the goodly gear that should shield him in his need. And they cast over all a rich surcoat and set the golden spurs on his heels and girt him with a trusty sword fastened with a silken bawdrick. When he was thus clad his harness was costly for the least loop or latchet gleamed with gold. So armed as he was he hearkened Mass and made his offering at the high altar. Then he came to the king and the knights of his court and courteously took leave of lords and ladies and they kissed him and commended him to Christ.
With that was Gringalet ready girt with a saddle that gleamed gaily with many golden fringes enriched and decked anew for the venture. The bridle was all barred about with bright gold buttons and all the covertures and trappings of the steed the crupper and the rich skirts accorded with the saddle; spread fair with the rich red gold that glittered and gleamed in the rays of the sun.
Then the knight called for his helmet which was well lined throughout and set it high on his head and hasped it behind. He wore a light kerchief over the vintail that was broidered and studded with fair gems on a broad silken ribbon with birds of gay colour and many a turtle and true-lover's knot interlaced thickly even as many a maiden had wrought diligently for seven winter long. But the circlet which crowned his helmet was yet more precious being adorned with a device in diamonds. Then they brought him his shield which was of bright red with the pentangle painted thereon in gleaming gold.7 And why that noble prince bare the pentangle I am minded to tell you though my tale tarry thereby. It is a sign that Solomon set ere-while as betokening truth; for it is a figure with five points and each line overlaps the other and nowhere hath it beginning or end so that in English it is called ""the endless knot."" And therefore was it well suiting to this knight and to his arms since Gawain was faithful in five and five-fold for pure was he as gold void of all villainy and endowed with all virtues. Therefore he bare the pentangle on shield and surcoat as truest of heroes and gentlest of knights.
For first he was faultless in his five senses; and his five fingers never failed him; and all his trust upon earth was in the five wounds that Christ bare on the cross as the Creed tells. And wherever this knight found himself in stress of battle he deemed well that he drew his strength from the five joys which the Queen of Heaven had of her Child. And for this cause did he bear an image of Our Lady on the one half of his shield that whenever he looked upon it he might not lack for aid. And the fifth five that the hero used were frankness and fellowship above all purity and courtesy that never failed him and compassion that surpasses all; and in these five virtues was that hero wrapped and clothed. And all these five-fold were linked one in the other so that they had no end and were fixed on five points that never failed neither at any side were they joined or sundered nor could ye find beginning or end. And therefore on his shield was the knot shapen red-gold upon red which is the pure pentangle. Now was Sir Gawain ready and he took his lance in hand and bade them all Farewell he deemed it had been for ever.
Then he smote the steed with his spurs and sprang on his way so that sparks flew from the stones after him. All that saw him were grieved at heart and said one to the other ""By Christ 'tis great pity that one of such noble life should be lost! I'faith 'twere not easy to find his equal upon earth. The king had done better to have wrought more warily. Yonder knight should have been made a duke; a gallant leader of men is he and such a fate had beseemed him better than to be hewn in pieces at the will of an elfish man for mere pride. Who ever knew a king to take such counsel as to risk his knights on a Christmas jest?"" Many were the tears that flowed from their eyes when that goodly knight rode from the hall. He made no delaying but went his way swiftly and rode many a wild road as I heard say in the book.
So rode Sir Gawain through the realm of Logres on an errand that he held for no jest. Often he lay companionless at night and must lack the fare that he liked. No comrade had he save his steed and none save God with whom to take counsel. At length he drew nigh to North Wales and left the isles of Anglesey on his left hand crossing over the fords by the foreland over at Holyhead till he came into the wilderness of Wirral8 where but few dwell who love God and man of true heart. And ever he asked as he fared of all whom he met if they had heard any tidings of a Green Knight in the country thereabout or of a Green Chapel? And all answered him Nay never in their lives had they seen any man of such a hue. And the knight wended his way by many a strange road and many a rugged path and the fashion of his countenance changed full often ere he saw the Green Chapel.
Many a cliff did he climb in that unknown land where afar from his friends he rode as a stranger. Never did he come to a stream or a ford but he found a foe before him and that one so marvellous so foul and fell that it behoved him to fight. So many wonders did that knight behold that it were too long to tell the tenth part of them. Sometimes he fought with dragons and wolves; sometimes with wild men that dwelt in the rocks; another while with bulls and bears and wild boars or with giants of the high moorland that drew near to him. Had he not been a doughty knight enduring and of well-proved valour and a servant of God doubtless he had been slain for he was oft in danger of death. Yet he cared not so much for the strife what he deemed worse was when the cold clear water was shed from the clouds and froze ere it fell on the fallow ground. More nights than enough he slept in his harness on the bare rocks near slain with the sleet while the stream leapt bubbling from the crest of the hills and hung in hard icicles over his head.
Thus in peril and pain and many a hardship the knight rode alone till Christmas Eve and in that tide he made his prayer to the Blessed Virgin that she would guide his steps and lead him to some dwelling. On that morning he rode by a hill and came into a thick forest wild and drear; on each side were high hills and thick woods below them of great hoar oaks a hundred together of hazel and hawthorn with their trailing boughs intertwined and rough ragged moss spreading everywhere. On the bare twigs the birds chirped piteously for pain of the cold. The knight upon Gringalet rode lonely beneath them through marsh and mire much troubled at heart lest he should fail to see the service of the Lord who on that self-same night was born of a maiden for the cure of our grief; and therefore he said sighing ""I beseech Thee Lord and Mary Thy gentle Mother for some shelter where I may hear Mass and Thy mattins at morn. This I ask meekly and thereto I pray my Paternoster Ave and Credo."" Thus he rode praying and lamenting his misdeeds and he crossed himself and said ""May the Cross of Christ speed me.""
Now that knight had crossed himself but thrice ere he was aware in the wood of a dwelling within a moat above a lawn on a mound surrounded by many mighty trees that stood round the moat. 'Twas the fairest castle that ever a knight owned9; built in a meadow with a park all about it and a spiked palisade closely driven that enclosed the trees for more than two miles. The knight was ware of the hold from the side as it shone through the oaks. Then he lifted off his helmet and thanked Christ and S. Julian that they had courteously granted his prayer and hearkened to his cry. ""Now"" quoth the knight ""I beseech ye grant me fair hostel."" Then he pricked Gringalet with his golden spurs and rode gaily towards the great gate and came swiftly to the bridge end.
The bridge was drawn up and the gates close shut; the walls were strong and thick so that they might fear no tempest. The knight on his charger abode on the bank of the deep double ditch that surrounded the castle. The walls were set deep in the water and rose aloft to a wondrous height; they were of hard hewn stone up to the corbels which were adorned beneath the battlements with fair carvings and turrets set in between with many a loophole; a better barbican Sir Gawain had never looked upon. And within he beheld the high hall with its tower and many windows with carven cornices and chalk-white chimneys on the turreted roofs that shone fair in the sun. And everywhere thickly scattered on the castle battlements were pinnacles so many that it seemed as if it were all wrought out of paper so white was it.
The knight on his steed deemed it fair enough if he might come to be sheltered within it to lodge there while that the Holy-day lasted. He called aloud and soon there came a porter of kindly countenance who stood on the wall and greeted this knight and asked his errand.
""Good sir"" quoth Gawain ""wilt thou go mine errand to the high lord of the castle and crave for me lodging?""
""Yea by S. Peter"" quoth the porter. ""In sooth I trow that ye be welcome to dwell here so long as it may like ye.""
Then he went and came again swiftly and many folk with him to receive the knight. They let down the great drawbridge and came forth and knelt on their knees on the cold earth to give him worthy welcome. They held wide open the great gates and courteously he bid them rise and rode over the bridge. Then men came to him and held his stirrup while he dismounted and took and stabled his steed. There came down knights and squires to bring the guest with joy to the hall. When he raised his helmet there were many to take it from his hand fain to serve him and they took from him sword and shield.
Sir Gawain gave good greeting to the noble and the mighty men who came to do him honour. Clad in his shining armour they led him to the hall where a great fire burnt brightly on the floor; and the lord of the household came forth from his chamber to meet the hero fitly. He spake to the knight and said: ""Ye are welcome to do here as it likes ye. All that is here is your own to have at your will and disposal.""
""Gramercy!"" quote Gawain ""may Christ requite ye.""
As friends that were fain each embraced the other; and Gawain looked on the knight who greeted him so kindly and thought 'twas a bold warrior that owned that burg.
Of mighty stature he was and of high age; broad and flowing was his beard and of a bright hue. He was stalwart of limb and strong in his stride his face fiery red and his speech free: in sooth he seemed one well fitted to be a leader of valiant men.
Then the lord led Sir Gawain to a chamber and commanded folk to wait upon him and at his bidding there came men enough who brought the guest to a fair bower. The bedding was noble with curtains of pure silk wrought with gold and wondrous coverings of fair cloth all embroidered. The curtains ran on ropes with rings of red gold and the walls were hung with carpets of Orient and the same spread on the floor. There with mirthful speeches they took from the guest his byrny and all his shining armour and brought him rich robes of the choicest in its stead. They were long and flowing and became him well and when he was clad in them all who looked on the hero thought that surely God had never made a fairer knight: he seemed as if he might be a prince without peer in the field where men strive in battle.
Then before the hearth-place whereon the fire burned they made ready a chair for Gawain hung about with cloth and fair cushions; and there they cast around him a mantle of brown samite richly embroidered and furred within with costly skins of ermine with a hood of the same and he seated himself in that rich seat and warmed himself at the fire and was cheered at heart. And while he sat thus the serving men set up a table on trestles and covered it with a fair white cloth and set thereon salt-cellar and napkin and silver spoons; and the knight washed at his will and set him down to meat.
The folk served him courteously with many dishes seasoned of the best a double portion. All kinds of fish were there some baked in bread some broiled on the embers some sodden some stewed and savoured with spices with all sorts of cunning devices to his taste. And often he called it a feast when they spake gaily to him all together and said ""Now take ye this penance and it shall be for your amendment."" Much mirth thereof did Sir Gawain make.
Then they questioned that prince courteously of whence he came; and he told them that he was of the court of Arthur who is the rich royal King of the Round Table and that it was Gawain himself who was within their walls and would keep Christmas with them as the chance had fallen out. And when the lord of the castle heard those tidings he laughed aloud for gladness and all men in that keep were joyful that they should be in the company of him to whom belonged all fame and valour and courtesy and whose honour was praised above that of all men on earth. Each said softly to his fellow ""Now shall we see courteous bearing and the manner of speech befitting courts. What charm lieth in gentle speech shall we learn without asking since here we have welcomed the fine father of courtesy. God has surely shewn us His grace since He sends us such a guest as Gawain! When men shall sit and sing blithe for Christ's birth this knight shall bring us to the knowledge of fair manners and it may be that hearing him we may learn the cunning speech of love.""
By the time the knight had risen from dinner it was near nightfall. Then chaplains took their way to the chapel and rang loudly even as they should for the solemn evensong of the high feast. Thither went the lord and the lady also and entered with her maidens into a comely closet and thither also went Gawain. Then the lord took him by the sleeve and led him to a seat and called him by his name and told him he was of all men in the world the most welcome. And Sir Gawain thanked him truly and each kissed the other and they sat gravely together throughout the service.
Then was the lady fain to look upon that knight; and she came forth from her closet with many fair maidens. The fairest of ladies was she in face and figure and colouring fairer even than Guinevere so the knight thought. She came through the chancel to greet the hero another lady held her by the left hand older than she and seemingly of high estate with many nobles about her. But unlike to look upon were those ladies for if the younger were fair the elder was yellow. Rich red were the cheeks of the one rough and wrinkled those of the other; the kerchiefs of the one were broidered with many glistening pearls her throat and neck bare and whiter than the snow that lies on the hills; the neck of the other was swathed in a gorget with a white wimple over her black chin. Her forehead was wrapped in silk with many folds worked with knots so that naught of her was seen save her black brows her eyes her nose and her lips and those were bleared and ill to look upon. A worshipful lady in sooth one might call her! In figure was she short and broad and thickly made–far fairer to behold was she whom she led by the hand.
When Gawain beheld that fair lady who looked at him graciously with leave of the lord he went towards them and bowing low he greeted the elder but the younger and fairer he took lightly in his arms and kissed her courteously and greeted her in knightly wise. Then she hailed him as friend and he quickly prayed to be counted as her servant if she so willed. Then they took him between them and talking led him to the chamber to the hearth and bade them bring spices and they brought them in plenty with the good wine that was wont to be drunk at such seasons. Then the lord sprang to his feet and bade them make merry and took off his hood and hung it on a spear and bade him win the worship thereof who should make most mirth that Christmas-tide. ""And I shall try by my faith to fool it with the best by the help of my friends ere I lose my raiment."" Thus with gay words the lord made trial to gladden Gawain with jests that night till it was time to bid them light the tapers and Sir Gawain took leave of them and gat him to rest.
In the morn when all men call to mind how Christ our Lord was born on earth to die for us there is joy for His sake in all dwellings of the world; and so was there here on that day. For high feast was held with many dainties and cunningly cooked messes. On the daïs sat gallant men clad in their best. The ancient dame sat on the high seat with the lord of the castle beside her. Gawain and the fair lady sat together even in the midst of the board when the feast was served; and so throughout all the hall each sat in his degree and was served in order. There was meat there was mirth there was much joy so that to tell thereof would take me too long though peradventure I might strive to declare it. But Gawain and that fair lady had much joy of each other's company through her sweet words and courteous converse. And there was music made before each prince trumpets and drums and merry piping; each man hearkened his minstrel and they too hearkened theirs.
So they held high feast that day and the next and the third day thereafter and the joy on S. John's Day was fair to hearken for 'twas the last of the feast and the guests would depart in the grey of the morning. Therefore they awoke early and drank wine and danced fair carols and at last when it was late each man took his leave to wend early on his way. Gawain would bid his host farewell but the lord took him by the hand and led him to his own chamber beside the hearth and there he thanked him for the favour he had shown him in honouring his dwelling at that high season and gladdening his castle with his fair countenance. ""I wis sir that while I live I shall be held the worthier that Gawain has been my guest at God's own feast.""
""Gramercy sir"" quoth Gawain ""in good faith all the honour is yours may the High King give it you and I am but at your will to work your behest inasmuch as I am beholden to you in great and small by rights.""
Then the lord did his best to persuade the knight to tarry with him but Gawain answered that he might in no wise do so. Then the host asked him courteously what stern behest had driven him at the holy season from the king's court to fare all alone ere yet the feast was ended?
""Forsooth"" quoth the knight ""ye say but the truth: 'tis a high quest and a pressing that hath brought me afield for I am summoned myself to a certain place and I know not whither in the world I may wend to find it; so help me Christ I would give all the kingdom of Logres an I might find it by New Year's morn. Therefore sir I make request of you that ye tell me truly if ye ever heard word of the Green Chapel where it may be found and the Green Knight that keeps it. For I am pledged by solemn compact sworn between us to meet that knight at the New Year if so I were on life; and of that same New Year it wants but little–I'faith I would look on that hero more joyfully than on any other fair sight! Therefore by your will it behoves me to leave you for I have but barely three days and I would as fain fall dead as fail of mine errand.""
Then the lord quoth laughing ""Now must ye needs stay for I will show you your goal the Green Chapel ere your term be at an end have ye no fear! But ye can take your ease friend in your bed till the fourth day and go forth on the first of the year and come to that place at mid-morn to do as ye will. Dwell here till New Year's Day and then rise and set forth and ye shall be set in the way; 'tis not two miles hence.""
Then was Gawain glad and he laughed gaily. ""Now I thank you for this above all else. Now my quest is achieved I will dwell here at your will and otherwise do as ye shall ask.""
Then the lord took him and set him beside him and bade the ladies be fetched for their greater pleasure tho' between themselves they had solace. The lord for gladness made merry jest even as one who wist not what to do for joy; and he cried aloud to the knight ""Ye have promised to do the thing I bid ye: will ye hold to this behest here at once?""
""Yea forsooth"" said that true knight ""while I abide in your burg I am bound by your behest.""
""Ye have travelled from far"" said the host ""and since then ye have waked with me ye are not well refreshed by rest and sleep as I know. Ye shall therefore abide in your chamber and lie at your ease tomorrow at Mass-tide and go to meat when ye will with my wife who shall sit with you and comfort you with her company till I return; and I shall rise early and go forth to the chase."" And Gawain agreed to all this courteously.
""Sir knight"" quoth the host ""we shall make a covenant. Whatsoever I win in the wood shall be yours and whatever may fall to your share that shall ye exchange for it. Let us swear friend to make this exchange however our hap may be for worse or for better.""
""I grant ye your will"" quoth Gawain the good; ""if ye list so to do it liketh me well.""
""Bring hither the wine-cup the bargain is made"" so said the lord of that castle. They laughed each one and drank of the wine and made merry these lords and ladies as it pleased them. Then with gay talk and merry jest they arose and stood and spoke softly and kissed courteously and took leave of each other. With burning torches and many a serving-man was each led to his couch; yet ere they gat them to bed the old lord oft repeated their covenant for he knew well how to make sport. *****
Full early ere daylight the folk rose up; the guests who would depart called their grooms and they made them ready and saddled the steeds tightened up the girths and trussed up their mails. The knights all arrayed for riding leapt up lightly and took their bridles and each rode his way as pleased him best.
The lord of the land was not the last. Ready for the chase with many of his men he ate a sop hastily when he had heard Mass and then with blast of the bugle fared forth to the field.10 He and his nobles were to horse ere daylight glimmered upon the earth.
Then the huntsmen coupled their hounds unclosed the kennel door and called them out. They blew three blasts gaily on the bugles the hounds bayed fiercely and they that would go a-hunting checked and chastised them. A hundred hunters there were of the best so I have heard tell. Then the trackers gat them to the trysting-place and uncoupled the hounds and forest rang again with their gay blasts.
At the first sound of the hunt the game quaked for fear and fled trembling along the vale. They betook them to the heights but the liers in wait turned them back with loud cries; the harts they let pass them and the stags with their spreading antlers for the lord had forbidden that they should be slain but the hinds and the does they turned back and drave down into the valleys. Then might ye see much shooting of arrows. As the deer fled under the boughs a broad whistling shaft smote and wounded each sorely so that wounded and bleeding they fell dying on the banks. The hounds followed swiftly on their tracks and hunters blowing the horn sped after them with ringing shouts as if the cliffs burst asunder. What game escaped those that shot was run down at the outer ring. Thus were they driven on the hills and harassed at the waters so well did the men know their work and the greyhounds were so great and swift that they ran them down as fast as the hunters could slay them. Thus the lord passed the day in mirth and joyfulness even to nightfall.
So the lord roamed the woods and Gawain that good night lay ever a-bed curtained about under the costly coverlet while the daylight gleamed on the walls. And as he lay half slumbering he heard a little sound at the door and he raised his head and caught back a corner of the curtain and waited to see what it might be. It was the lovely lady the lord's wife; she shut the door softly behind her and turned towards the bed; and Gawain was shamed laid him down softly and made as if he slept. And she came lightly to the bedside within the curtain and sat herself down beside him to wait till he wakened. The knight lay there awhile and marvelled within himself what her coming might betoken; and he said to himself ""'Twere more seemly if I asked her what hath brought her hither."" Then he made feint to waken and turned towards her and opened his eyes as one astonished and crossed himself; and she looked on him laughing with her cheeks red and white lovely to behold and small smiling lips.
""Good morrow Sir Gawain"" said that fair lady; ""ye are but a careless sleeper since one can enter thus. Now are ye taken unawares and lest ye escape me I shall bind you in your bed; of that be ye assured!"" Laughing she spake these words.
""Good morrow fair lady"" quoth Gawain blithely. ""I will do your will as it likes me well. For I yield me readily and pray your grace and that is best by my faith since I needs must do so."" Thus he jested again laughing. ""But an ye would fair lady grant me this grace that ye pray your prisoner to rise. I would get me from bed and array me better then could I talk with ye in more comfort.""
""Nay forsooth fair sir"" quoth the lady ""ye shall not rise I will rede ye better. I shall keep ye here since ye can do no other and talk with my knight whom I have captured. For I know well that ye are Sir Gawain whom all the world worships wheresoever ye may ride. Your honour and your courtesy are praised by lords and ladies by all who live. Now ye are here and we are alone my lord and his men are afield; the serving men in their beds and my maidens also and the door shut upon us. And since in this hour I have him that all men love I shall use my time well with speech while it lasts. Ye are welcome to my company for it behoves me in sooth to be your servant.""
""In good faith"" quoth Gawain ""I think me that I am not him of whom ye speak for unworthy am I of such service as ye here proffer. In sooth I were glad if I might set myself by word or service to your pleasure; a pure joy would it be to me!""
""In good faith Sir Gawain"" quoth the gay lady ""the praise and the prowess that pleases all ladies I lack them not nor hold them light; yet are there ladies enough who would liever now have the knight in their hold as I have ye here to dally with your courteous words to bring them comfort and to ease their cares than much of the treasure and the gold that are theirs. And now through the grace of Him who upholds the heavens I have wholly in my power that which they all desire!""
Thus the lady fair to look upon made him great cheer and Sir Gawain with modest words answered her again: ""Madam"" he quoth ""may Mary requite ye for in good faith I have found in ye a noble frankness. Much courtesy have other folk shown me but the honour they have done me is naught to the worship of yourself who knoweth but good.""
""By Mary"" quoth the lady ""I think otherwise; for were I worth all the women alive and had I the wealth of the world in my hand and might choose me a lord to my liking then for all that I have seen in ye Sir Knight of beauty and courtesy and blithe semblance and for all that I have hearkened and hold for true there should be no knight on earth to be chosen before ye!""
""Well I wot"" quoth Sir Gawain ""that ye have chosen a better; but I am proud that ye should so prize me and as your servant do I hold ye my sovereign and your knight am I and may Christ reward ye.""
So they talked of many matters till mid-morn was past and ever the lady made as though she loved him and the knight turned her speech aside. For though she were the brightest of maidens yet had he forborne to shew her love for the danger that awaited him and the blow that must be given without delay.
Then the lady prayed her leave from him and he granted it readily. And she gave [the text reads ""have""] him good-day with laughing glance but he must needs marvel at her words:
""Now He that speeds fair speech reward ye this disport; but that ye be Gawain my mind misdoubts me greatly.""
""Wherefore?"" quoth the knight quickly fearing lest he had lacked in some courtesy.
And the lady spake: ""So true a knight as Gawain is holden and one so perfect in courtesy would never have tarried so long with a lady but he would of his courtesy have craved a kiss at parting.""
Then quoth Gawain ""I wot I will do even as it may please ye and kiss at your commandment as a true knight should who forbears to ask for fear of displeasure.""
At that she came near and bent down and kissed the knight and each commended the other to Christ and she went forth from the chamber softly.
Then Sir Gawain arose and called his chamberlain and chose his garments and when he was ready he gat him forth to Mass and then went to meat and made merry all day till the rising of the moon and never had a knight fairer lodging than had he with those two noble ladies the elder and the younger.
And even the lord of the land chased the hinds through holt and heath till eventide and then with much blowing of bugles and baying of hounds they bore the game homeward; and by the time daylight was done all the folk had returned to that fair castle. And when the lord and Sir Gawain met together then were they both well pleased. The lord commanded them all to assemble in the great hall and the ladies to descend with their maidens and there before them all he bade the men fetch in the spoil of the day's hunting and he called unto Gawain and counted the tale of the beasts and showed them unto him and said ""What think ye of this game Sir Knight? Have I deserved of ye thanks for my woodcraft?""
""Yea I wis"" quoth the other ""here is the fairest spoil I have seen this seven year in the winter season.""
""And all this do I give ye Gawain"" quoth the host ""for by accord of covenant ye may claim it as your own.""
""That is sooth"" quoth the other ""I grant you that same; and I have fairly won this within walls and with as good will do I yield it to ye."" With that he clasped his hands round the lord's neck and kissed him as courteously as he might. ""Take ye here my spoils no more have I won; ye should have it freely though it were greater than this.""
""'Tis good"" said the host ""gramercy thereof. Yet were I fain to know where ye won this same favour and if it were by your own wit?""
""Nay"" answered Gawain ""that was not in the bond. Ask me no more: ye have taken what was yours by right be content with that.""
They laughed and jested together and sat them down to supper where they were served with many dainties; and after supper they sat by the hearth and wine was served out to them; and oft in their jesting they promised to observe on the morrow the same covenant that they had made before and whatever chance might betide to exchange their spoil be it much or little when they met at night. Thus they renewed their bargain before the whole court and then the night-drink was served and each courteously took leave of the other and gat him to bed.
By the time the cock had crowed thrice the lord of the castle had left his bed; Mass was sung and meat fitly served. The folk were forth to the wood ere the day broke with hound and horn they rode over the plain and uncoupled their dogs among the thorns. Soon they struck on the scent and the hunt cheered on the hounds who were first to seize it urging them with shouts. The others hastened to the cry forty at once and there rose such a clamour from the pack that the rocks rang again. The huntsmen spurred them on with shouting and blasts of the horn; and the hounds drew together to a thicket betwixt the water and a high crag in the cliff beneath the hillside. There where the rough rock fell ruggedly they the huntsmen fared to the finding and cast about round the hill and the thicket behind them. The knights wist well what beast was within and would drive him forth with the bloodhounds. And as they beat the bushes suddenly over the beaters there rushed forth a wondrous great and fierce boar long since had he left the herd to roam by himself. Grunting he cast many to the ground and fled forth at his best speed without more mischief. The men hallooed loudly and cried ""Hay! Hay!"" and blew the horns to urge on the hounds and rode swiftly after the boar. Many a time did he turn to bay and tare the hounds and they yelped and howled shrilly. Then the men made ready their arrows and shot at him but the points were turned on his thick hide and the barbs would not bite upon him for the shafts shivered in pieces and the head but leapt again wherever it hit.
But when the boar felt the stroke of the arrows he waxed mad with rage and turned on the hunters and tare many so that affrightened they fled before him. But the lord on a swift steed pursued him blowing his bugle; as a gallant knight he rode through the woodland chasing the boar till the sun grew low.
So did the hunters this day while Sir Gawain lay in his bed lapped in rich gear; and the lady forgat not to salute him for early was she at his side to cheer his mood.
She came to the bedside and looked on the knight and Gawain gave her fit greeting and she greeted him again with ready words and sat her by his side and laughed and with a sweet look she spoke to him:
""Sir if ye be Gawain I think it a wonder that ye be so stern and cold and care not for the courtesies of friendship but if one teach ye to know them ye cast the lesson out of your mind. Ye have soon forgotten what I taught ye yesterday by all the truest tokens that I knew!""
""What is that?"" quoth the knight. ""I trow I know not. If it be sooth that ye say then is the blame mine own.""
""But I taught ye of kissing "" quoth the fair lady. ""Wherever a fair countenance is shown him it behoves a courteous knight quickly to claim a kiss.""
""Nay my dear"" said Sir Gawain ""cease that speech; that durst I not do lest I were denied for if I were forbidden I wot I were wrong did I further entreat.""
""I' faith"" quoth the lady merrily ""ye may not be forbid ye are strong enough to constrain by strength an ye will were any so discourteous as to give ye denial.""
""Yea by Heaven"" said Gawain ""ye speak well; but threats profit little in the land where I dwell and so with a gift that is given not of good will! I am at your commandment to kiss when ye like to take or to leave as ye list.""
Then the lady bent her down and kissed him courteously.
And as they spake together she said ""I would learn somewhat from ye an ye would not be wroth for young ye bare and fair and so courteous and knightly as ye are known to be the head of all chivalry and versed in all wisdom of love and war–'tis ever told of true knights how they adventured their lives for their true love and endured hardships for her favours and avenged her with valour and eased her sorrows and brought joy to her bower; and ye are the fairest knight of your time and your fame and your honour are everywhere yet I have sat by ye here twice and never a word have I heard of love! Ye who are so courteous and skilled in such love ought surely to teach one so young and unskilled some little craft of true love! Why are ye so unlearned who art otherwise so famous? Or is it that ye deemed me unworthy to hearken to your teaching? For shame Sir Knight! I come hither alone and sit at your side to learn of ye some skill; teach me of your wit while my lord is from home.""
""In good faith"" quoth Gawain ""great is my joy and my profit that so fair a lady as ye are should deign to come hither and trouble ye with so poor a man and make sport with your knight with kindly countenance it pleaseth me much. But that I in my turn should take it upon me to tell of love and such like matters to ye who know more by half or a hundred fold of such craft than I do or ever shall in all my lifetime by my troth 'twere folly indeed! I will work your will to the best of my might as I am bounden and evermore will I be your servant so help me Christ!""
Then often with guile she questioned that knight that she might win him to woo her but he defended himself so fairly that none might in any wise blame him and naught but bliss and harmless jesting was there between them. They laughed and talked together till at last she kissed him and craved her leave of him and went her way.
Then the knight arose and went forth to Mass and afterward dinner was served and he sat and spake with the ladies all day. But the lord of the castle rode ever over the land chasing the wild boar that fled through the thickets slaying the best of his hounds and breaking their backs in sunder; till at last he was so weary he might run no longer but made for a hole in a mound by a rock. He got the mound at his back and faced the hounds whetting his white tusks and foaming at the mouth. The huntsmen stood aloof fearing to draw nigh him; so many of them had been already wounded that they were loth to be torn with his tusks so fierce he was and mad with rage. At length the lord himself came up and saw the beast at bay and the men standing aloof. Then quickly he sprang to the ground and drew out a bright blade and waded through the stream to the boar.
When the beast was aware of the knight with weapon in hand he set up his bristles and snorted loudly and many feared for their lord lest he should be slain. Then the boar leapt upon the knight so that beast and man were one atop of the other in the water; but the boar had the worst of it for the man had marked even as he sprang and set the point of his brand to the beast's chest and drove it up to the hilt so that the heart was split in twain and the boar fell snarling and was swept down by the water to where a hundred hounds seized on him and the men drew him to shore for the dogs to slay.
Then was there loud blowing of horns and baying of hounds the huntsmen smote off the boar's head and hung the carcase by the four feet to a stout pole and so went on their way homewards. The head they bore before the lord himself who had slain the beast at the ford by force of his strong hand.
It seemed him o'er long ere he saw Sir Gawain in the hall and he called and the guest came to take that which fell to his share. And when he saw Gawain the lord laughed aloud and bade them call the ladies and the household together and he showed them the game and told them the tale how they hunted the wild boar through the woods and of his length and breadth and height; and Sir Gawain commended his deeds and praised him for his valour well proven for so mighty a beast had he never seen before.
Then they handled the huge head and the lord said aloud ""Now Gawain this game is your own by sure covenant as ye right well know.""
""'Tis sooth"" quoth the knight ""and as truly will I give ye all I have gained."" He took the host round the neck and kissed him courteously twice. ""Now are we quits"" he said ""this eventide of all the covenants that we made since I came hither.""
And the lord answered ""By S. Giles ye are the best I know; ye will be rich in a short space if ye drive such bargains!""
Then they set up the tables on trestles and covered them with fair cloths and lit waxen tapers on the walls. The knights sat and were served in the hall and much game and glee was there round the hearth with many songs both at supper and after; song of Christmas and new carols with all the mirth one may think of. And ever that lovely lady sat by the knight and with still stolen looks made such feint of pleasing him that Gawain marvelled much and was wroth with himself but he could not for his courtesy return her fair glances but dealt with her cunningly however she might strive to wrest the thing.
When they had tarried in the hall so long as it seemed them good they turned to the inner chamber and the wide hearthplace and there they drank wine and the host proffered to renew the covenant for New Year's Eve; but the knight craved leave to depart on the morrow for it was nigh to the term when he must fulfil his pledge. But the lord would withhold him from so doing and prayed him to tarry and said
""As I am a true knight I swear my troth that ye shall come to the Green Chapel to achieve your task on New Year's morn long before prime. Therefore abide ye in your bed and I will hunt in this wood and hold ye to the covenant to exchange with me against all the spoil I may bring hither. For twice have I tried ye and found ye true and the morrow shall be the third time and the best. Make we merry now while we may and think on joy for misfortune may take a man whensoever it wills.""
Then Gawain granted his request and they brought them drink and they gat them with lights to bed.
Sir Gawain lay and slept softly but the lord who was keen on woodcraft was afoot early. After Mass he and his men ate a morsel and he asked for his steed; all the knights who should ride with him were already mounted before the hall gates.
'Twas a fair frosty morning for the sun rose red in ruddy vapour and the welkin was clear of clouds. The hunters scattered them by a forest side and the rocks rang again with the blast of their horns. Some came on the scent of a fox and a hound gave tongue; the huntsmen shouted and the pack followed in a crowd on the trail. The fox ran before them and when they saw him they pursued him with noise and much shouting and he wound and turned through many a thick grove often cowering and hearkening in a hedge. At last by a little ditch he leapt out of a spinney stole away slily by a copse path and so out of the wood and away from the hounds. But he went ere he wist to a chosen tryst and three started forth on him at once so he must needs double back and betake him to the wood again.
Then was it joyful to hearken to the hounds; when all the pack had met together and had sight of their game they made as loud a din as if all the lofty cliffs had fallen clattering together. The huntsmen shouted and threatened and followed close upon him so that he might scarce escape but Reynard was wily and he turned and doubled upon them and led the lord and his men over the hills now on the slopes now in the vales while the knight at home slept through the cold morning beneath his costly curtains.
But the fair lady of the castle rose betimes and clad herself in a rich mantle that reached even to the ground left her throat and her fair neck bare and was bordered and lined with costly furs. On her head she wore no golden circlet but a network of precious stones that gleamed and shone through her tresses in clusters of twenty together. Thus she came into the chamber closed the door after her and set open a window and called to him gaily ""Sir Knight how may ye sleep? The morning is so fair.""
Sir Gawain was deep in slumber and in his dream he vexed him much for the destiny that should befall him on the morrow when he should meet the knight at the Green Chapel and abide his blow; but when the lady spake he heard her and came to himself and roused from his dream and answered swiftly. The lady came laughing and kissed him courteously and he welcomed her fittingly with a cheerful countenance. He saw her so glorious and gaily dressed so faultless of features and complexion that it warmed his heart to look upon her.
They spake to each other smiling and all was bliss and good cheer between them. They exchanged fair words and much happiness was therein yet was there a gulf between them and she might win no more of her knight for that gallant prince watched well his words–he would neither take her love nor frankly refuse it. He cared for his courtesy lest he be deemed churlish and yet more for his honour lest he be traitor to his host. ""God forbid"" quoth he to himself ""that it should so befall."" Thus with courteous words did he set aside all the special speeches that came from her lips.
Then spake the lady to the knight ""Ye deserve blame if ye hold not that lady who sits beside ye above all else in the world if ye have not already a love whom ye hold dearer and like better and have sworn such firm faith to that lady that ye care not to loose it–and that am I now fain to believe. And now I pray ye straitly that ye tell me that in truth and hide it not.""
And the knight answered ""By S. John"" (and he smiled as he spake) ""no such love have I nor do I think to have yet awhile.""
""That is the worst word I may hear"" quoth the lady ""but in sooth I have mine answer; kiss me now courteously and I will go hence; I can but mourn as a maiden that loves much.""
Sighing she stooped down and kissed him and then she rose up and spake as she stood ""Now dear at our parting do me this grace: give me some gift if it were but thy glove that I may bethink me of my knight and lessen my mourning.""
""Now I wis"" quoth the knight ""I would that I had here the most precious thing that I possess on earth that I might leave ye as love-token great or small for ye have deserved forsooth more reward than I might give ye. But it is not to your honour to have at this time a glove for reward as gift from Gawain and I am here on a strange errand and have no man with me nor mails with goodly things–that mislikes me much lady at this time; but each man must fare as he is taken if for sorrow and ill.""
""Nay knight highly honoured"" quoth that lovesome lady ""though I have naught of yours yet shall ye have somewhat of mine."" With that she reached him a ring of red gold with a sparkling stone therein that shone even as the sun (wit ye well it was worth many marks); but the knight refused it and spake readily
""I will take no gift lady at this time. I have none to give and none will I take.""
She prayed him to take it but he refused her prayer and sware in sooth that he would not have it.
The lady was sorely vexed and said ""If ye refuse my ring as too costly that ye will not be so highly beholden to me I will give you my girdle 11 as a lesser gift."" With that she loosened a lace that was fastened at her side knit upon her kirtle under her mantle. It was wrought of green silk and gold only braided by the fingers and that she offered to the knight and besought him though it were of little worth that he would take it and he said nay he would touch neither gold nor gear ere God give him grace to achieve the adventure for which he had come hither. ""And therefore I pray ye displease ye not and ask me no longer for I may not grant it. I am dearly beholden to ye for the favour ye have shown me and ever in heat and cold will I be your true servant.""
""Now"" said the lady ""ye refuse this silk for it is simple in itself and so it seems indeed; lo it is small to look upon and less in cost but whoso knew the virtue that is knit therein he would peradventure value it more highly. For whatever knight is girded with this green lace while he bears it knotted about him there is no man under heaven can overcome him for he may not be slain for any magic on earth.""
Then Gawain bethought him and it came into his heart that this were a jewel for the jeopardy that awaited him when he came to the Green Chapel to seek the return blow–could he so order it that he should escape unslain 'twere a craft worth trying. Then he bare with her chiding and let her say her say and she pressed the girdle on him and prayed him to take it and he granted her prayer and she gave it him with good will and besought him for her sake never to reveal it but to hide it loyally from her lord; and the knight agreed that never should any man know it save they two alone. He thanked her often and heartily and she kissed him for the third time.
Then she took her leave of him and when she was gone Sir Gawain arose and clad him in rich attire and took the girdle and knotted it round him and hid it beneath his robes. Then he took his way to the chapel and sought out a priest privily and prayed him to teach him better how his soul might be saved when he should go hence; and there he shrived him and showed his misdeeds both great and small and besought mercy and craved absolution; and the priest assoiled him and set him as clean as if Doomsday had been on the morrow. And afterwards Sir Gawain made him merry with the ladies with carols and all kinds of joy as never he did but that one day even to nightfall; and all the men marvelled at him and said that never since he came thither had he been so merry.
Meanwhile the lord of the castle was abroad chasing the fox; awhile he lost him and as he rode through a spinny he heard the hounds near at hand and Reynard came creeping through a thick grove with all the pack at his heels. Then the lord drew out his shining brand and cast it at the beast and the fox swerved aside for the sharp edge and would have doubled back but a hound was on him ere he might turn and right before the horse's feet they all fell on him and worried him fiercely snarling the while.
Then the lord leapt from his saddle and caught the fox from the jaws and held it aloft over his head and hallooed loudly and many brave hounds bayed as they beheld it; and the hunters hied them thither blowing their horns; all that bare bugles blew them at once and all the others shouted. 'Twas the merriest meeting that ever men heard the clamour that was raised at the death of the fox. They rewarded the hounds stroking them and rubbing their heads and took Reynard and stripped him of his coat; then blowing their horns they turned them homewards for it was nigh nightfall.
The lord was gladsome at his return and found a bright fire on the hearth and the knight beside it the good Sir Gawain who was in joyous mood for the pleasure he had had with the ladies. He wore a robe of blue that reached even to the ground and a surcoat richly furred that became him well. A hood like to the surcoat fell on his shoulders and all alike were done about with fur. He met the host in the midst of the floor and jesting he greeted him and said ""Now shall I be first to fulfil our covenant which we made together when there was no lack of wine."" Then he embraced the knight and kissed him thrice as solemnly as he might.
""Of a sooth"" quoth the other ""ye have good luck in the matter of this covenant if ye made a good exchange!""
""Yea it matters naught of the exchange"" quoth Gawain ""since what I owe is swiftly paid.""
""Marry"" said the other ""mine is behind for I have hunted all this day and naught have I got but this foul fox-skin and that is but poor payment for three such kisses as ye have here given me.""
""Enough"" quoth Sir Gawain ""I thank ye by the Rood.""
Then the lord told them of his hunting and how the fox had been slain.
With mirth and minstrelsy and dainties at their will they made them as merry as a folk well might till 'twas time for them to sever for at last they must needs betake them to their beds. Then the knight took his leave of the lord and thanked him fairly.
""For the fair sojourn that I have had here at this high feast may the High King give ye honour. I give ye myself as one of your servants if ye so like; for I must needs as you know go hence with the morn and ye will give me as ye promised a guide to show me the way to the Green Chapel an God will suffer me on New Year's Day to deal the doom of my weird.""
""By my faith"" quoth the host ""all that ever I promised that shall I keep with good will."" Then he gave him a servant to set him in the way and lead him by the downs that he should have no need to ford the stream and should fare by the shortest road through the groves; and Gawain thanked the lord for the honour done him. Then he would take leave of the ladies and courteously he kissed them and spake praying them to receive his thanks and they made like reply; then with many sighs they commended him to Christ and he departed courteously from that folk. Each man that he met he thanked him for his service and his solace and the pains he had been at to do his will; and each found it as hard to part from the knight as if he had ever dwelt with him.
Then they led him with torches to his chamber and brought him to his bed to rest. That he slept soundly I may not say for the morrow gave him much to think on. Let him rest awhile for he was near that which he sought and if ye will but listen to me I will tell ye how it fared with him thereafter. *****
Now the New Year drew nigh and the night passed and the day chased the darkness as is God's will; but wild weather wakened therewith. The clouds cast the cold to the earth with enough of the north to slay them that lacked clothing. The snow drave smartly and the whistling wind blew from the heights and made great drifts in the valleys. The knight lying in his bed listened for though his eyes were shut he might sleep but little and hearkened every cock that crew.
He arose ere the day broke by the light of a lamp that burned in his chamber and called to his chamberlain bidding him bring his armour and saddle his steed. The other gat him up and fetched his garments and robed Sir Gawain.
First he clad him in his clothes to keep off the cold and then in his harness which was well and fairly kept. Both hauberk and plates were well burnished the rings of the rich byrny freed from rust and all as fresh as at first so that the knight was fain to thank them. Then he did on each piece and bade them bring his steed while he put the fairest raiment on himself; his coat with its fair cognizance adorned with precious stones upon velvet with broidered seams and all furred within with costly skins. And he left not the lace the lady's gift that Gawain forgot not for his own good. When he had girded on his sword he wrapped the gift twice about him swathed around his waist. The girdle of green silk set gaily and well upon the royal red cloth rich to behold but the knight ware it not for pride of the pendants polished though they were with fair gold that gleamed brightly on the ends but to save himself from sword and knife when it behoved him to abide his hurt without question. With that the hero went forth and thanked that kindly folk full often.
Then was Gringalet ready that was great and strong and had been well cared for and tended in every wise; in fair condition was that proud steed and fit for a journey. Then Gawain went to him and looked on his coat and said by his sooth ""There is a folk in this place that thinketh on honour; much joy may they have and the lord who maintains them and may all good betide that lovely lady all her life long. Since they for charity cherish a guest and hold honour in their hands may He who holds the heaven on high requite them and also ye all. And if I might live anywhere on earth I would give ye full reward readily if so I might."" Then he set foot in the stirrup and bestrode his steed and his squire gave him his shield which he laid on his shoulder. Then he smote Gringalet with his golden spurs and the steed pranced on the stones and would stand no longer.
By that his man was mounted who bare his spear and lance and Gawain quoth ""I commend this castle to Christ may He give it ever good fortune."" Then the drawbridge was let down and the broad gates unbarred and opened on both sides; the knight crossed himself and passed through the gateway and praised the porter who knelt before the prince and gave him good-day and commended him to God. Thus the knight went on his way with the one man who should guide him to that dread place where he should receive rueful payment.
The two went by hedges where the boughs were bare and climbed the cliffs where the cold clings. Naught fell from the heavens but 'twas ill beneath them; mist brooded over the moor and hung on the mountains; each hill had a cap a great cloak of mist. The streams foamed and bubbled between their banks dashing sparkling on the shores where they shelved downwards. Rugged and dangerous was the way through the woods till it was time for the sun-rising. Then were they on a high hill; the snow lay white beside them and the man who rode with Gawain drew rein by his master.
""Sir"" he said ""I have brought ye hither and now ye are not far from the place that ye have sought so specially. But I will tell ye for sooth since I know ye well and ye are such a knight as I well love would ye follow my counsel ye would fare the better. The place whither ye go is accounted full perilous for he who liveth in that waste is the worst on earth for he is strong and fierce and loveth to deal mighty blows; taller is he than any man on earth and greater of frame than any four in Arthur's court or in any other. And this is his custom at the Green Chapel; there may no man pass by that place however proud his arms but he does him to death by force of his hand for he is a discourteous knight and shews no mercy. Be he churl or chaplain who rides by that chapel monk or mass priest or any man else he thinks it as pleasant to slay them as to pass alive himself. Therefore I tell ye as sooth as ye sit in saddle if ye come there and that knight know it ye shall be slain though ye had twenty lives; trow me that truly! He has dwelt here full long and seen many a combat; ye may not defend ye against his blows. Therefore good Sir Gawain let the man be and get ye away some other road; for God's sake seek ye another land and there may Christ speed ye! And I will hie me home again and I promise ye further that I will swear by God and the saints or any other oath ye please that I will keep counsel faithfully and never let any wit the tale that ye fled for fear of any man.""
""Gramercy"" quoth Gawain but ill-pleased. ""Good fortune be his who wishes me good and that thou wouldst keep faith with me I will believe; but didst thou keep it never so truly an I passed here and fled for fear as thou sayest then were I a coward knight and might not be held guiltless. So I will to the chapel let chance what may and talk with that man even as I may list whether for weal or for woe as fate may have it. Fierce though he may be in fight yet God knoweth well how to save His servants.""
""Well"" quoth the other ""now that ye have said so much that ye will take your own harm on yourself and ye be pleased to lose your life I will neither let nor keep ye. Have here your helm and the spear in your hand and ride down this same road beside the rock till ye come to the bottom of the valley and there look a little to the left hand and ye shall see in that vale the chapel and the grim man who keeps it. Now fare ye well noble Gawain; for all the gold on earth I would not go with ye nor bear ye fellowship one step further."" With that the man turned his bridle into the wood smote the horse with his spurs as hard as he could and galloped off leaving the knight alone.
Quoth Gawain ""I will neither greet nor groan but commend myself to God and yield me to His will.""
Then the knight spurred Gringalet and rode adown the path close in by a bank beside a grove. So he rode through the rough thicket right into the dale and there he halted for it seemed him wild enough. No sign of a chapel could he see but high and burnt banks on either side and rough rugged crags with great stones above. An ill-looking place he thought it.
Then he drew in his horse and looked around to seek the chapel but he saw none and thought it strange. Then he saw as it were a mound on a level space of land by a bank beside the stream where it ran swiftly the water bubbled within as if boiling. The knight turned his steed to the mound and lighted down and tied the rein to the branch of a linden; and he turned to the mound and walked round it questioning with himself what it might be. It had a hole at the end and at either side and was overgrown with clumps of grass and it was hollow within as an old cave or the crevice of a crag; he knew not what it might be.
""Ah"" quoth Gawain ""can this be the Green Chapel? Here might the devil say his mattins at midnight! Now I wis there is wizardry here. 'Tis an ugly oratory all overgrown with grass and 'twould well beseem that fellow in green to say his devotions on devil's wise. Now feel I in five wits 'tis the foul fiend himself who hath set me this tryst to destroy me here! This is a chapel of mischance: ill-luck betide it 'tis the cursedest kirk that ever I came in!""
Helmet on head and lance in hand he came up to the rough dwelling when he heard over the high hill beyond the brook as it were in a bank a wondrous fierce noise that rang in the cliff as if it would cleave asunder. 'Twas as if one ground a scythe on a grindstone it whirred and whetted like water on a mill-wheel and rushed and rang terrible to hear.
""By God"" quoth Gawain ""I trow that gear is preparing for the knight who will meet me here. Alas! naught may help me yet should my life be forfeit I fear not a jot!"" With that he called aloud. ""Who waiteth in this place to give me tryst? Now is Gawain come hither: if any man will aught of him let him hasten hither now or never.""
""Stay"" quoth one on the bank above his head ""and ye shall speedily have that which I promised ye."" Yet for a while the noise of whetting went on ere he appeared and then he came forth from a cave in the crag with a fell weapon a Danish axe newly dight wherewith to deal the blow. An evil head it had four feet large no less sharply ground and bound to the handle by the lace that gleamed brightly. And the knight himself was all green as before face and foot locks and beard but now he was afoot. When he came to the water he would not wade it but sprang over with the pole of his axe and strode boldly over the brent that was white with snow.
Sir Gawain went to meet him but he made no low bow. The other said ""Now fair sir one may trust thee to keep tryst. Thou art welcome Gawain to my place. Thou hast timed thy coming as befits a true man. Thou knowest the covenant set between us: at this time twelve months agone thou didst take that which fell to thee and I at this New Year will readily requite thee. We are in this valley verily alone here are no knights to sever us do what we will. Have off thy helm from thine head and have here thy pay; make me no more talking than I did then when thou didst strike off my head with one blow.""
""Nay"" quoth Gawain ""by God that gave me life I shall make no moan whatever befall me but make thou ready for the blow and I shall stand still and say never a word to thee do as thou wilt.""
With that he bent his head and shewed his neck all bare and made as if he had no fear for he would not be thought a-dread.
Then the Green Knight made him ready and grasped his grim weapon to smite Gawain. With all his force he bore it aloft with a mighty feint of slaying him: had it fallen as straight as he aimed he who was ever doughty of deed had been slain by the blow. But Gawain swerved aside as the axe came gliding down to slay him as he stood and shrank a little with the shoulders for the sharp iron. The other heaved up the blade and rebuked the prince with many proud words:
""Thou art not Gawain"" he said ""who is held so valiant that never feared he man by hill or vale but thou shrinkest for fear ere thou feelest hurt. Such cowardice did I never hear of Gawain! Neither did I flinch from thy blow or make strife in King Arthur's hall. My head fell to my feet and yet I fled not; but thou didst wax faint of heart ere any harm befell. Wherefore must I be deemed the braver knight.""
Quoth Gawain ""I shrank once but so will I no more though an my head fall on the stones I cannot replace it. But haste Sir Knight by thy faith and bring me to the point deal me my destiny and do it out of hand for I will stand thee a stroke and move no more till thine axe have hit me–my troth on it.""
""Have at thee then"" quoth the other and heaved aloft the axe with fierce mien as if he were mad. He struck at him fiercely but wounded him not withholding his hand ere it might strike him.
Gawain abode the stroke and flinched in no limb but stood still as a stone or the stump of a tree that is fast rooted in the rocky ground with a hundred roots.
Then spake gaily the man in green ""So now thou hast thine heart whole it behoves me to smite. Hold aside thy hood that Arthur gave thee and keep thy neck thus bent lest it cover it again.""
Then Gawain said angrily ""Why talk on thus? Thou dost threaten too long. I hope thy heart misgives thee.""
""For sooth"" quoth the other ""so fiercely thou speakest I will no longer let thine errand wait its reward."" Then he braced himself to strike frowning with lips and brow 'twas no marvel that it pleased but ill him who hoped for no rescue. He lifted the axe lightly and let it fall with the edge of the blade on the bare neck. Though he struck swiftly it hurt him no more than on the one side where it severed the skin. The sharp blade cut into the flesh so that the blood ran over his shoulder to the ground. And when the knight saw the blood staining the snow he sprang forth swift-foot more than a spear's length seized his helmet and set it on his head cast his shield over his shoulder drew out his bright sword and spake boldly (never since he was born was he half so blithe) ""Stop Sir Knight bid me no more blows. I have stood a stroke here without flinching and if thou give me another I shall requite thee and give thee as good again. By the covenant made betwixt us in Arthur's hall but one blow falls to me here. Halt therefore.""
Then the Green Knight drew off from him and leaned on his axe setting the shaft on the ground and looked on Gawain as he stood all armed and faced him fearlessly–at heart it pleased him well. Then he spake merrily in a loud voice and said to the knight ""Bold sir be not so fierce no man here hath done thee wrong nor will do save by covenant as we made at Arthur's court. I promised thee a blow and thou hast it–hold thyself well paid! I release thee of all other claims. If I had been so minded I might perchance have given thee a rougher buffet. First I menaced thee with a feigned one and hurt thee not for the covenant that we made in the first night and which thou didst hold truly. All the gain didst thou give me as a true man should. The other feint I proffered thee for the morrow: my fair wife kissed thee and thou didst give me her kisses–for both those days I gave thee two blows without scathe–true man true return. But the third time thou didst fail and therefore hadst thou that blow. For 'tis my weed thou wearest that same woven girdle my own wife wrought it that do I wot for sooth. Now know I well thy kisses and thy conversation and the wooing of my wife for 'twas mine own doing. I sent her to try thee and in sooth I think thou art the most faultless knight that ever trode earth. As a pearl among white peas is of more worth than they so is Gawain i' faith by other knights. But thou didst lack a little Sir Knight and wast wanting in loyalty yet that was for no evil work nor for wooing neither but because thou lovedst thy life–therefore I blame thee the less.""
Then the other stood a great while still sorely angered and vexed within himself; all the blood flew to his face and he shrank for shame as the Green Knight spake; and the first words he said were ""Cursed be ye cowardice and covetousness for in ye is the destruction of virtue."" Then he loosed the girdle and gave it to the knight. ""Lo take there the falsity may foul befall it! For fear of thy blow cowardice bade me make friends with covetousness and forsake the customs of largess and loyalty which befit all knights. Now am I faulty and false and have been afeared: from treachery and untruth come sorrow and care. I avow to thee Sir Knight that I have ill done; do then thy will. I shall be more wary hereafter.""
Then the other laughed and said gaily ""I wot I am whole of the hurt I had and thou hast made such free confession of thy misdeeds and hast so borne the penance of mine axe edge that I hold thee absolved from that sin and purged as clean as if thou hadst never sinned since thou wast born. And this girdle that is wrought with gold and green like my raiment do I give thee Sir Gawain that thou mayest think upon this chance when thou goest forth among princes of renown and keep this for a token of the adventure of the Green Chapel as it chanced between chivalrous knights. And thou shalt come again with me to my dwelling and pass the rest of this feast in gladness."" Then the lord laid hold of him and said ""I wot we shall soon make peace with my wife who was thy bitter enemy.""
""Nay forsooth"" said Sir Gawain and seized his helmet and took it off swiftly and thanked the knight: ""I have fared ill may bliss betide thee and may He who rules all things reward thee swiftly. Commend me to that courteous lady thy fair wife and to the other my honoured ladies who have beguiled their knight with skilful craft. But 'tis no marvel if one be made a fool and brought to sorrow by women's wiles for so was Adam beguiled by one and Solomon by many and Samson all too soon for Delilah dealt him his doom; and David thereafter was wedded with Bathsheba which brought him much sorrow–if one might love a woman and believe her not 'twere great gain! And since all they were beguiled by women methinks 'tis the less blame to me that I was misled! But as for thy girdle that will I take with good will not for gain of the gold nor for samite nor silk nor the costly pendants neither for weal nor for worship but in sign of my frailty. I shall look upon it when I ride in renown and remind myself of the fault and faintness of the flesh; and so when pride uplifts me for prowess of arms the sight of this lace shall humble my heart. But one thing would I pray if it displease thee not: since thou art lord of yonder land wherein I have dwelt tell me what thy rightful name may be and I will ask no more.""
""That will I truly"" quoth the other. ""Bernlak de Hautdesert am I called in this land. Morgain le Fay dwelleth in mine house 12 and through knowledge of clerkly craft hath she taken many. For long time was she the mistress of Merlin who knew well all you knights of the court. Morgain the goddess is she called therefore and there is none so haughty but she can bring him low. She sent me in this guise to yon fair hall to test the truth of the renown that is spread abroad of the valour of the Round Table. She taught me this marvel to betray your wits to vex Guinevere and fright her to death by the man who spake with his head in his hand at the high table. That is she who is at home that ancient lady she is even thine aunt Arthur's half-sister the daughter of the Duchess of Tintagel who afterward married King Uther. Therefore I bid thee knight come to thine aunt and make merry in thine house; my folk love thee and I wish thee as well as any man on earth by my faith for thy true dealing.""
But Sir Gawain said nay he would in no wise do so; so they embraced and kissed and commended each other to the Prince of Paradise and parted right there on the cold ground. Gawain on his steed rode swiftly to the king's hall and the Green Knight got him whithersoever he would.
Sir Gawain who had thus won grace of his life rode through wild ways on Gringalet; oft he lodged in a house and oft without and many adventures did he have and came off victor full often as at this time I cannot relate in tale. The hurt that he had in his neck was healed he bare the shining girdle as a baldric bound by his side and made fast with a knot 'neath his left arm in token that he was taken in a fault–and thus he came in safety again to the court.
Then joy awakened in that dwelling when the king knew that the good Sir Gawain was come for he deemed it gain. King Arthur kissed the knight and the queen also and many valiant knights sought to embrace him. They asked him how he had fared and he told them all that had chanced to him–the adventure of the chapel the fashion of the knight the love of the lady–at last of the lace. He showed them the wound in the neck which he won for his disloyalty at the hand of the knight the blood flew to his face for shame as he told the tale.
""Lo lady"" he quoth and handled the lace ""this is the bond of the blame that I bear in my neck this is the harm and the loss I have suffered the cowardice and covetousness in which I was caught the token of my covenant in which I was taken. And I must needs wear it so long as I live for none may hide his harm but undone it may not be for if it hath clung to thee once it may never be severed.""
Then the king comforted the knight and the court laughed loudly at the tale and all made accord that the lords and the ladies who belonged to the Round Table each hero among them should wear bound about him a baldric of bright green for the sake of Sir Gawain.13 And to this was agreed all the honour of the Round Table and he who ware it was honoured the more thereafter as it is testified in the best book of romance. That in Arthur's days this adventure befell the book of Brutus bears witness. For since that bold knight came hither first and the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy I wis

Many a venture herebefore
Hath fallen such as this:
May He that bare the crown of thorn
Bring us unto His bliss.

Amen.


Footnotes

1. ""The Legend of Sir Gawain"" Grimm Library Vol. VII. (Chapter IX. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight).

2. Dance accompanied by song. Often mentioned in old romances.

3. Agravain ""à la dure main."" This characterisation of Gawain's brother seems to indicate that there was a French source at the root of this story. The author distinctly tells us more than once that the tale as he tells it was written in a book M. Gaston Paris thinks that the direct source was an Anglo-Norman poem now lost.

4. If any in this hall holds himself so hardy. This the main incident of the tale is apparently of very early date. The oldest version we possess is that found in the Irish tale of the Fled Bricrend (Bricriu's feast) [edited and translated by the Rev. G. Henderson M.A. Irish Texts Society vol. ii.] where the hero of the tale is the Irish champion Cuchulinn. Two mediæval romances the Mule sans Frein (French) and Diu Krône (German) again attribute it to Gawain; while the continuator of Chrétien de Troye's Conte del Graal gives as hero a certain Carados whom he represents as Arthur's nephew; and the prose Perceval has Lancelot. So far as the mediæval versions are concerned the original hero is undoubtedly Gawain; and our poem gives the fullest and most complete form of the story we possess. In the Irish version the magician is a giant and the abnormal size and stature of the Green Knight is in all probability the survival of a primitive feature. His curious colour is a trait found nowhere else. In Diu Krône we are told that the challenger changes shapes in a terrifying manner but no details are given.

5. For Yule was over-past. This passage descriptive of the flight of the year should be especially noticed. Combined with the other passages–the description of Gawain's journey the early morning hunts the dawning of New Year's Day and the ride to the Green Chapel–they indicate a knowledge of Nature and an observant eye for her moods uncommon among mediæval poets. It is usual enough to find graceful and charming descriptions of spring and early summer–an appreciation of May in especial when the summer courts were held is part of the stock-in-trade of mediæval romancers–but a sympathy with the year in all its changes is far rarer and certainly deserves to be specially reckoned to the credit of this nameless writer.

6. First a rich carpet was stretched on the floor. The description of the arming of Gawain is rather more detailed in the original but some of the minor points are not easy to understand the identification of sundry of the pieces of armour being doubtful.

7. The pentangle painted thereupon in gleaming gold. I do not remember that the pentangle is elsewhere attributed to Gawain. He often bears a red shield; but the blazon varies. Indeed the heraldic devices borne by Arthur's knights are distractingly chaotic–their legends are older than the science of heraldry and no one has done for them the good office that the compiler of the Thidrek Saga has rendered to his Teutonic heroes.

8. The Wilderness of Wirral. This is in Cheshire. Sir F. Madden suggests that the forest which forms the final stage of Gawain's journey is that of Inglewood in Cumberland. The geography here is far clearer than is often the case in such descriptions.

9. 'Twas the fairest castle that ever a knight owned. Here again I have omitted some of the details of the original the architectural terms lacking identification.

10. With blast of the bugle fared forth to the field. The account of each day's hunting contains a number of obsolete terms and details of woodcraft not given in full. The meaning of some has been lost and the minute descriptions of skinning and dismembering the game would be distinctly repulsive to the general reader. They are valuable for a student of the history of the English sport but interfere with the progress of the story. The fact that the author devotes so much space to them seems to indicate that he lived in the country and was keenly interested in field sports. (Gottfried von Strassbourg's Tristan contains a similar and almost more detailed description.)

11. I will give [you] my girdle. This magic girdle which confers invulnerability on its owner is a noticeable feature of our story. It is found nowhere else in this connection yet in other romances we find that Gawain possesses a girdle with similar powers (cf. my Legend of Sir Gawain Chap. IX.). Such a talisman was also owned by Cuchulinn the Irish hero who has many points of contact with Gawain. It seems not improbable that this was also an old feature of the story. I have commented in the Introduction on the lady's persistent wooing of Gawain and need not repeat the remarks here. The Celtic Lay of the Great Fool (Amadan Mor) presents some curious points of contact with our story which may however well be noted here. In the Lay the hero is mysteriously deprived of his legs through the draught from a cup proffered by a Gruagach or magician. He comes to a castle the lord of which goes out hunting leaving his wife in the care of the Great Fool who is to allow no man to enter. He falls asleep and a young knight arrives and kisses the host's wife. The Great Fool awaking refuses to allow the intruder to depart; and in spite of threats and blandishments insists on detaining him till the husband returns. Finally the stranger reveals himself as the host in another shape; he is also the Gruagach who deprived the hero of his limbs and the Great Fool's brother. He has only intended to test the Amadon Mor's fidelity. A curious point in connection with this story is that it possesses a prose opening which shows a marked affinity with the ""Perceval"" enfances. That the Perceval and Gawain stories early became connected is certain but what is the precise connection between them and the Celtic Lay is not clear. In its present form the latter is certainly posterior to the Grail romances but it is quite possible that the matter with which it deals represents a tradition older than the Arthurian story.

12. Morgain le Fay who dwelleth in my house. The enmity between Morgain le Fay and Guinevere which is here stated to have been the motif of the enchantment is no invention of the author but is found in the Merlin probably the earliest of the Arthurian prose romances. In a later version of our story a poem written in ballad form and contained in the ""Percy"" MS. Morgain does not appear; her place is taken by an old witch mother to the lady but the enchantment is still due to her spells. In this later form the knight bears the curious name of Sir Bredbeddle. That given in our romance Bernlak de Hautdesert seems to point to the original French source of the story. (It is curious that Morgain should here be represented as extremely old while Arthur is still in his first youth. There is evidently a discrepancy or misunderstanding of the source here.)

13. A baldric of bright green for sake of Sir Gawain. The later version connects this lace with that worn by the knights of the Bath; but this latter was white not green. The knights wore it on the left shoulder till they had done some gallant deed or till some noble lady took it off for them.

Once in royal David's city
Stood a lowly cattle shed
Where a mother laid her Baby
In a manger for His bed:
Mary was that mother mild
Jesus Christ her little Child

He came down to earth from heaven
Who is God and Lord of all
And His shelter was a stable
And His cradle was a stall;
With the poor and mean and lowly
Lived on earth our Saviour holy

And our eyes at last shall see Him
Through His own redeeming love;
For that Child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heaven above
And He leads His children on
To the place where He is gone
Not in that poor lowly stable
With the oxen standing by
We shall see Him; but in heaven
Set at God's right hand on high;
When like stars His children crowned
All in white shall wait around

O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see Thee lie
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in Thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the Holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth

How silently how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven
No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him
Still the dear Christ enters in

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the Blessed Child
Where misery cries out to Thee
Son of the Mother mild
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door
The dark night wakes the glory breaks
And Christmas comes once more

O Holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel

Going through the hills on a night all starry
On the way to Bethlehem
Far away I heard a shepherd boy piping
On the way to Bethlehem

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for joy that Christ the newborn King
Is come to bring us peace on earth
And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem.""

""Tell me shepherd boy piping tunes so merrily
On the way to Bethlehem
Who will hear your tunes on these hills so lonely
On the way to Bethlehem?

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for the joy that Christ the newborn King
Is come to bring peace on earth
And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem.""

""None may hear my pipes on these hills so lonely
On the way to Bethlehem;
But a King will hear me play sweet lullabies
When I get to Bethlehem.""

Angels in the sky came down from on high
Hovered over the manger where the babe was lying
Cradled in the arms of his mother Mary
Sleeping now at Bethlehem

""Where is the new King shepherd boy piping merrily
Is He there at Bethlehem?""
""I will find Him soon by the star shining brightly
In the sky o'vr Bethlehem.""

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for joy that Christ the king of Kings
Is come to bring us peace on earth
And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem.""

""May I come with you shepherd boy piping merrily
Come with you to Bethlehem?
Pay my homage too at the new King's cradle
Is it far to Bethlehem?""

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for joy that Christ the newborn King
Is born in the stable yonder born for you and me.""

You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donder and Blitzen.
But do you recall?
The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
But instead it just kept on raining
A veil of tears for the Virgin Birth
I remember one Christmas Morning
A winters light and a distant choir
And the peal of a bell and that Christmas Tree smell
And their eyes full of tinsel and fire

They sold me a dream of Christmas
They sold me a Silent Night
They told me a fairy story
'Till I believed in the Israelite
And I believed in Father Christmas
And I looked to the Sky with excited eyes
'Till I woke with a yawn in the first Light of dawn
And I saw him and through his disguise

I wish you a hopeful Christmas
I wish you a brave New Year
All anguish pain and sadness
Leave your Heart and let your road be clear
They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
Hallelujah Noel be it Heaven or hell

It's a narrow narrow make your bed
And learn to lie your lane;
For I'm ga'n oer the sea Fair Annie
A braw bride to bring hame.
Wi her I will get gowd and gear;
Wi you I neer got nane.
""But wha will bake my bridal bread
Or brew my bridal ale?
And wha will welcome my brisk bride
That I bring oer the dale?""
""It's I will bake your bridal bread
And brew your bridal ale
And I will welcome your brisk bride
That you bring oer the dale.""
""But she that welcomes my brisk bride
Maun gang like maiden fair;
She maun lace on her robe sae jimp
And braid her yellow hair.""
""But how can I gang maiden-like
When maiden I am nane?
Have I not born seven sons to thee
And am with child again?""
She's taen her young son in her arms
Another in her hand
And she's up to the highest tower
To see him come to land.
""Come up come up my eldest son
And look oer yon sea-strand
And see your father's new-come bride
Before she come to land.""
""Come down come down my mother dear
Come frae the castle wa!
I fear if langer ye stand there
Ye'll let yoursell down fa.""
And she gaed down and farther down
Her love's ship for to see
And the topmast and the mainmast
Shone like the silver free.
And she's gane down and farther down
The bride's ship to behold
And the topmast and the mainmast
They shone just like the gold.
She's taen her seven sons in her hand
I wot she didna fail;
She met Lord Thomas and his bride
As they came oer the dale.
""You're welcome to your house Lord Thomas
You're welcome to your land;
You're welcome with your fair ladye
That you lead by the hand.
""You're welcome to your ha's ladye
You're welcome to your bowers;
You're welcome to your hame ladye
For a' that's here is yours.""

Sae dearly as I thank thee;
You're the likest to my sister Annie
That ever I did see.
""There came a knight out oer the sea
And steald my sister away;
The shame scoup in his company
And land whereer he gae!""
She hang ae napkin at the door
Another in the ha
And a' to wipe the trickling tears
Sae fast as they did fa.
And aye she served the lang tables
With white bread and with wine
And aye she drank the wan water
To had her colour fine.
And he's taen down the silk napkin
Hung on a silver pin
And aye he wipes the tear trickling
A' down her cheik and chin.
And aye he turn'd him round about
And smil'd amang his men;
Says ""Like ye best the old ladye
Or her that's new come hame?""
When bells were rung and mass was sung
And a' men bound to bed
Lord Thomas and his new-come bride
To their chamber they were gaed.
Annie made her bed a little forbye
To hear what they might say;
""And ever alas!"" Fair Annie cried
""That I should see this day!
""Gin my seven sons were seven young rats
Running on the castle wa
And I were a grey cat mysell
I soon would worry them a'.
""Gin my seven sons were seven young hares
Running oer yon lilly lee
And I were a grew hound mysell
Soon worried they a' should be.""
And wae and sad Fair Annie sat
And drearie was her sang
And ever as she sobbd and grat
""Wae to the man that did the wrang!""
""My gown is on"" said the new-come bride
""My shoes are on my feet
And I will to Fair Annie's chamber
And see what gars her greet.
""What ails ye what ails ye Fair Annie
That ye make sic a moan?
Has your wine barrels cast the girds
Or is your white bread gone?
""O wha was't was your father Annie
Or wha was't was your mother?
And had ye ony sister Annie
Or had ye ony brother?""
""The Earl of Wemyss was my father
The Countess of Wemyss my mother;
And a' the folk about the house
To me were sister and brother.
""If the Earl of Wemyss was your father
I wot sae was he mine;
And it shall not be for lack o gowd
That ye your love sall tine.
""For I have seven ships o mine ain
A' loaded to the brim
And I will gie them a' to thee
Wi four to thine eldest son:
But thanks to a' the powers in heaven

In the bleak midwinter frost wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron water like a stone;
Snow had fallen snow on snow snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter long ago
Our god heaven cannot hold him nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The lord God almighty jesus christ
Angels and archangels may have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
But his mother only in her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss
What can I give him poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb;
If I were a wise man I would do my part;
Yet what I can I give him: give my heart

In Jesus Christ the apple tree

For happiness I long have sought
And pleasure dearly I have bought:
I missed of all; but now I see
'Tis found in Christ the apple tree

I'm weary with my former toil
Here I will sit and rest awhile:
Under the shadow I will be
Of Jesus Christ the apple tree

This fruit doth make my soul to thrive
It keeps my dying faith alive;
Which makes my soul in haste to be
With Jesus Christ the apple tree

I.

       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep mine Holy One!
My flesh my Lord!—what name? I do not know
A name that seemeth not too high or low
       &nbsp       &nbspToo far from me or heaven:
My Jesus that is best! that word being given
By the majestic angel whose command
Was softly as a man's beseeching said
When I and all the earth appeared to stand
       &nbsp       &nbspIn the great overflow
Of light celestial from his wings and head.
       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep my saving One!


II.

And art Thou come for saving baby-browed
And speechless Being—art Thou come for saving?
The palm that grows beside our door is bowed
By treadings of the low wind from the south
A restless shadow through the chamber waving:
Upon its bough a bird sings in the sun
But Thou with that close slumber on Thy mouth
Dost seem of wind and sun already weary.
Art come for saving O my weary One?

III.

Perchance this sleep that shutteth out the dreary
Earth-sounds and motions opens on Thy soul
       &nbspHigh dreams on fire with God;
High songs that make the pathways where they roll
More bright than stars do theirs; and visions new
Of Thine eternal Nature's old abode.
       &nbspSuffer this mother's kiss
       &nbspBest thing that earthly is
To glide the music and the glory through
Nor narrow in Thy dream the broad upliftings
       &nbspOf any seraph wing.
Thus noiseless thus. Sleep sleep my dreaming One!

IV.

The slumber of His lips meseems to run
Through my lips to mine heart to all its shiftings
Of sensual life bringing contrariousness
In a great calm. I feel I could lie down
As Moses did and die[7]—and then live most.
I am 'ware of you heavenly Presences
That stand with your peculiar light unlost
Each forehead with a high thought for a crown
Unsunned i' the sunshine! I am 'ware. Ye throw
No shade against the wall! How motionless
Ye round me with your living statuary
While through your whiteness in and outwardly
Continual thoughts of God appear to go
Like light's soul in itself. I bear I bear
To look upon the dropt lids of your eyes
Though their external shining testifies
To that beatitude within which were
Enough to blast an eagle at his sun:
I fall not on my sad clay face before ye—
       &nbsp       &nbspI look on His. I know
My spirit which dilateth with the woe
       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspOf His mortality
       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspMay well contain your glory.
       &nbsp       &nbspYea drop your lids more low.
Ye are but fellow-worshippers with me!
       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep my worshipped One!


V.

We sate among the stalls at Bethlehem;
The dumb kine from their fodder turning them
       &nbspSoftened their hornèd faces
       &nbspTo almost human gazes
       &nbspToward the newly Born:
The simple shepherds from the star-lit brooks
       &nbspBrought visionary looks
As yet in their astonied hearing rung
       &nbspThe strange sweet angel-tongue:
The magi of the East in sandals worn
       &nbspKnelt reverent sweeping round
With long pale beards their gifts upon the ground
       &nbspThe incense myrrh and gold
These baby hands were impotent to hold:
So let all earthlies and celestials wait
       &nbspUpon Thy royal state.
       &nbspSleep sleep my kingly One!

VI.

I am not proud—meek angels ye invest
New meeknesses to hear such utterance rest
On mortal lips—""I am not proud""—not proud!
Albeit in my flesh God sent His Son
Albeit over Him my head is bowed
As others bow before Him still mine heart
Bows lower than their knees. O centuries
That roll in vision your futurities
       &nbsp       &nbspMy future grave athwart—
Whose murmurs seem to reach me while I keep
       &nbsp       &nbspWatch o'er this sleep—
Say of me as the Heavenly said—""Thou art
The blessedest of women!""—blessedest
Not holiest not noblest no high name
Whose height misplaced may pierce me like a shame
When I sit meek in heaven!
       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspFor me for me
God knows that I am feeble like the rest!
I often wandered forth more child than maiden
Among the midnight hills of Galilee
       &nbsp       &nbspWhose summits looked heaven-laden
Listening to silence as it seemed to be
God's voice so soft yet strong so fain to press
Upon my heart as heaven did on the height
And waken up its shadows by a light
And show its vileness by a holiness.
Then I knelt down most silent like the night
       &nbsp       &nbspToo self-renounced for fears
Raising my small face to the boundless blue
Whose stars did mix and tremble in my tears:
God heard them falling after with His dew.

VII.

So seeing my corruption can I see
This Incorruptible now born of me
This fair new Innocence no sun did chance
To shine on (for even Adam was no child)
Created from my nature all defiled
This mystery from out mine ignorance—
Nor feel the blindness stain corruption more
Than others do or I did heretofore?
Can hands wherein such burden pure has been
Not open with the cry ""unclean unclean""
More oft than any else beneath the skies?
       &nbsp       &nbspAh King ah Christ ah son!
The kine the shepherds the abasèd wise
       &nbsp       &nbspMust all less lowly wait
       &nbsp       &nbspThan I upon Thy state.
       &nbspSleep sleep my kingly One!

VIII.

Art Thou a King then? Come His universe
Come crown me Him a King!
Pluck rays from all such stars as never fling
       &nbspTheir light where fell a curse
And make a crowning for this kingly brow!—
What is my word? Each empyreal star
       &nbsp       &nbspSits in a sphere afar
       &nbsp       &nbspIn shining ambuscade:
       &nbsp       &nbspThe child-brow crowned by none
       &nbsp       &nbspKeeps its unchildlike shade.
       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep my crownless One!

IX.

Unchildlike shade! No other babe doth wear
An aspect very sorrowful as Thou.
No small babe-smiles my watching heart has seen
To float like speech the speechless lips between
No dovelike cooing in the golden air
No quick short joys of leaping babyhood.
       &nbsp       &nbspAlas our earthly good
In heaven thought evil seems too good for Thee;
       &nbsp       &nbspYet sleep my weary One!

X.

And then the drear sharp tongue of prophecy
With the dread sense of things which shall be done
Doth smite me inly like a sword: a sword?
That ""smites the Shepherd."" Then I think aloud
The words ""despised""—""rejected""—every word
Recoiling into darkness as I view
       &nbsp       &nbspThe Darling on my knee.
Bright angels—move not—lest ye stir the cloud
Betwixt my soul and His futurity!
I must not die with mother's work to do
       &nbsp       &nbspAnd could not live-and see.

XI.

       &nbspIt is enough to bear
       &nbspThis image still and fair
       &nbspThis holier in sleep
       &nbspThan a saint at prayer
       &nbspThis aspect of a child
       &nbspWho never sinned or smiled;
       &nbspThis Presence in an infant's face;
       &nbspThis sadness most like love
       &nbspThis love than love more deep
       &nbspThis weakness like omnipotence
       &nbspIt is so strong to move.
       &nbspAwful is this watching place
       &nbspAwful what I see from hence—
       &nbspA king without regalia
       &nbspA God without the thunder
       &nbspA child without the heart for play;
       &nbspAy a Creator rent asunder
       &nbspFrom His first glory and cast away
       &nbspOn His own world for me alone
To hold in hands created crying—Son!

XII.

       &nbspThat tear fell not on Thee
Beloved yet thou stirrest in thy slumber!
Thou stirring not for glad sounds out of number
Which through the vibratory palm-trees run
       &nbspFrom summer-wind and bird
       &nbspSo quickly hast thou heard
       &nbspA tear fall silently?
       &nbspWak'st thou O loving One?—

I don't want a lot for Christmas

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)

With a toy on Christmas Day

All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby all I want for Christmas is you
You baby

So brightly everywhere (So brightly baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh oh yeah)

Won't you please bring my baby to me?

This is all I'm asking for (Ah)

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh I wanna have him beside me like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th by that fireplace oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh baby
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
If he will be if he will be here
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
Oh woah

[Chorus]
Santa tell me (Santa tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Santa tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be if he won't be here)

'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Lagt i jord som blomsterfrø

Kom til at se sig tilbage

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

It is yeah - hello who is this?
Merry Christmas Melvyn
It can't be
Come on Mel how about pulling a cracker
By the look of you darling I think I already have
Get it

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple try to stop
Come on Melly-pops

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
Pumpkin pie anyone?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
This is so corny
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Wow I am in the most almighty Christmas groove
I haven't had this much fun
Since ""Two little boys"" was number one
If my friends could see me now
How do I look?
Ridiculous
You little tease
A dance Kimberley?

I do love a nice sax break
Yeah me too Kim but let's wait till the record's over
Kim do you think our love will last forever?
No
Couple of years maybe?
No
Do you think we'll make it to the end of the record?
How long is that - exactly?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
All together now
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Excuse me can I sing something now?
Get lost Griff!
Well that's nice...

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Root beer anyone?
Later we'll have pumpkin pie
And we'll do some carolling
There's plenty of pumpkin pie left by the way
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday

Wow yeah that was fantastic
Very nice

[Vers 1]
Miraklerne kommer når vi er klar
Klar til at glemme os selv
Drømmer vi nu eller glemmer vi blot at vi—
—vakler alene men sammen står—
Sammen står vi stærkere når—
—at det man kan tro på men ikke helt forstå
Viser vej
For dig og mig

[Omkvæd]
Mens vi går gennem gaderne
Så ved vi alt kan ske
Vi bryder barrikaderne
I en stjerneregn af sne
Og juleaften nærmer sig
Mens natten den bli'r lang
Mon lysetsengel viser sig
Og reder os fra undergang?

[Vers 2]
Orakler profeter og visemænd
Findes de stadig endnu?
Et barns fantasi er en verden af sand magi
Vi vakler alene men sammen står—
Sammen står vi stærkere når—
—at det man kan tro på men ikke helt forstå
Viser vej
For dig og mig

Mens vi går gennem gaderne
Så ved vi alt kan ske
Vi bryder barrikaderne
I en stjerneregn af sne
Og juleaften nærmer sig
Mens natten den bli'r lang

Og reder os fra undergang?

Julefreden sænkes stille over by
Mens vi venter på et tegn
Barnet sover trygt i lysetsengels favn
Vågner op til gaveregn

And it's been so long
But I will be there

To pass the time away

Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas

It's gonna take some time but I'll get there
Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh I got red lights all around
But soon there'll be a freeway yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
And feel you near me

Driving in my car
I'm driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
Just the same

Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh I got red lights all around
I'm driving home for Christmas yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

På julemænd og på damer

Af tilbud og reklamer

Og lys i barnlige øjne
Og Fanden selv står i TV og sælger
De sidste nye løgne

En lille sang om et håb
Der rækker helt fra Herodes til fremtid'n

Et fremmed barn alene i mørket
Et fremmed land uden lys
Så rækker du din hånd ud af mørket
Og pluds'lig er der lys

Når julen er forbi
Og et nyt år er på vej
Vil vi prøve at nå
Det vi drømte om i år

For en aller sidste gang
At huske at leve og bruge hvert sekundt vi får
Nu da den første sne
Igen
Er væk
Er det mer' på vej
Meget snart
Den smelted' i takt med
Så meget andet
Når solen skinner
Bliver alting klar
Når julen er forbi
Og et nyt år på vej
Vil vi prøve at nå
Det vi drømte om i år
Og vi lover hinanden
For en aller sidste gang
At huske at leve og bruge hvert sekundt vi får
Blanke krystaller der
Hvor sneen den lå
Bringer minder frem
Mens hjerterne slår
Der' altid så meget
At lave om på
Men stjernen på himlen
Den består
Når julen er forbi
Og et nyt år på vej
Vil vi prøve at nå

Bomberne finder vej
I dag
Og i nat
Mens vi tænder lys (mens vi tænder lys)
I mørket fordi (i mørket fordi)
Vi håber og tror på
Et nyt år tusind
Hvor mennesker lever
Helt uden krig
Når julen er forbi
Og et nyt år på vej
Vil vi prøve at nå
Det vi drømte om i år
Og vi lover hinanden
For en aller sidste gang
At huske at leve og bruge hvert sekundt vi får
Når julen er forbi

And I've brought me some corn for popping

Let it snow let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm

In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

[Verse 1]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said ""Winter love is spreading everywhere""
Summer came and took off with the Spring
So now we start the Christmas caroling
I'll find my way back home
And light up every tree
We will hang our stockings for you and one for me
Cause Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said ""Pack your bags and tell them you'll be there""

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise I promise I'll be home
Home I'll be home
(I'll be home)

[Verse 2]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said ""Wrap the gifts with all your love and care""
The wind it blows the snow up in the sky
But I won't let the wind delay my flight

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise I promise I'll be home
I'll be home I'll be home

[Intro]
Det skete i de dage i november engang
At de første kataloger satte hyggen i gang

[Vers 1]
Det' jul det' cool det' nu man hygger sig bedst
Det' julebal i Nisseland familiernes fest
Med fornøjet glimt i øjet trækker folk i vintertøjet
Til den årlige folkevandring op og ned ad Strøget
Der bli'r handlet pakket ind og der bli'r købt og solgt
Tøsne snot i næsen det' pisse koldt
Det er vinter man forventer vel lidt kulde og sne
Men det' da klart at en såd'n sag må komme bag på DSB
Intet vrøvl har de forsvoret det de helt sikre på
Men ved den første rim på sporet går møllen i stå
Folk de tripper skælder ud og ser på deres ure
Og sparker efter invalide ynkelige duer
Der er intet man kan gøre de sure buschauffører
Gør det svært at praktisere lidt julehumør
""Gå så tilbage for helvede"" råber stodderen hæst
Men det' jul det' cool det nu man hygger sig bedst

[Instrumentalt omkvæd]

[Vers 2]
Det' jul det' cool gran og lirekasser
Der er mænd der sælger juletræer på alle åbne pladser
12 bevægelige nisser og en sort mekanisk kat
I et vindue ud mod Strøget trækker flere tusind watt
Kulørte gavepakker i kulørte juleposer
Selv i Bilka og i Irma og i alle landets brugser
Er der ægte julestemning og gratis brune kager
Der er hylder fyldt med hygge der er hygge på lager
Og hoes damerne i Illum kan man få det som man vil
""Kontant eller på konto hr.? Ska' prisen dækkes til?""
De smiler og er flinke mest for fruerne i minke
Og gi'r gode råd om alt fra sexet undertøj til sminke
Og vi andre fattigrøve vi ka' gå i Dalle-Valle
Der er damerne så flinke at de smiler pænt til alle
Der er masser tøj i kasser der helt sikkert passer
Det' jul det' cool gran og lirekasser

[Instrumentalt omkvæd]

[Vers 3]
Det' jul det' cool kig dig lidt omkring
15.000 mennesker i Magasin
De har våde lædersko de har halstørklæder på
De har overfrakker gavepakker masser de ska' nå
Men de hygger sig sel'fø'lig gør de det
Plastik stjerner plastik gran og plastik sne
Sætter stemning i systemer det' så nemt og nul problemer
Køb blot julestuens julesæt med fire fine cremer
Eller sukkerkrukker pyntedukker pænt mondænt og ganske smukt
Søde sæt med proptrækker glas og øloplukker
Fra en skjult højttalerinstallation
""Et barn er født i Bethlehem"" i Hammondorgel-version
Vi' traditionsbundne folk i traditionernes land
Så vi hygger os li'så fint vi kan
Og særlig uundværlig det er Magasin
Det' jul det' cool kig dig lidt omkring

[Instrumentalt omkvæd]

[Mellemstykke]
""Højt fra træets grønne top""
""Mød julemanden klokken 13 15 og 17 på julestuen på 3. sal""
""Vores velassorterede vinafdeling kan tilbyde et komplet gløgg-sæt for kun 39.95""
""Lille Øyvind på fem år er blevet væk fra sin mor han kan afhentes i kundeservice""

[Vers 4]
""Jamen du godeste er det allerede...""
Jul det' cool sikke tiden den går
Der er intet lavet om siden sidste år
Det' de samme ting vi spiser det' de samme ting vi laver
De samme ting i TV de samme julegaver
Samme pengeproblemer det' dyrt og hårdt
Udelukkende overtrukne kontokort
Overflod og fråds med familie og med venner
Samvittigheden klares med en ulandskalender
Det' julefrokosttid traditionspilleri
Sprutkørsel utroskab og madsvineri
Vi har prøvet det før vi ved præcis hvad der sker
Slankekur i januar og alt det der
Det' et slid men der er lang tid til næste år
Det' jul det' cool sikke tiden den går

[Instrumentalt omkvæd]
""Jeg drømmer om en hvid sandstrand
Med palmetræer og sommervejr
Der vil jeg fejre julen
I swimmingpoolen
Langt væk fra sne og juletræer""

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""Let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day

[Bridge]
Oh a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Outro]
Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us (This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us  (So praise the lord)
And love may reign once more

Og jeg har liggesår og podegra og nyresvigt

Der' ingen der gider smage på min hagenbutten/pfirsich te
Min 2cv har fået stjålet sine fælge
Og Lone skred i går med en fyr der hedder Helge
Så kan man vælge bare at svælge i sorg og være bitter
For der er størknet linsesuppe på min sweater
Og jeg knokler for kommunen selvom jeg næsten ingen gage får
Det eneste der kører for mig er mit pagehår

There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world
Before I get too old
And don't remember it
So let's december it
And reassemble it (oh yeah)

Pre-Chorus:
Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To feel the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

Verse:
At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness?

With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Get my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style

Pre-Chorus:
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can know some happiness with me

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness

Bridge:
I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow and
They believe again

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time

[Verse 1]
Sleigh bells ring are you listenin'?
In the lane snow is glist’nin'
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walkin’ in a winter wonderland

[Verse 2]
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

[Chorus]
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" We'll say ""No man""
But you can do the job when you're in town

[Verse 3]
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Circus Clown
We’ll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

[Verse 4]
When it snows ain’t it thrillin'
Though your nose get’s a chillin'
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

[Outro]
Walkin’ in a winter wonderland
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow

[Verse 1]
It's that time of year I treasure
The time for giving the best part of living
To celebrate with friends we hold so dear
Well I can feel it in the air
All bundled head-to-toe
Too cold to bear it's the best time of the year

[Pre-Chorus]
I got my stocking got my Christmas tree
Got my loved ones next to me

[Chorus]
It's almost here
So spread some cheer
Let's give love and get some back
The more you give the more you'll have
The fire's bright now
And snow comes down
Grab your friends; hold them near
Christmas time is here
Whoo!

[Verse 2]
Every house on every corner
Stringing up the Christmas lights
People caroling ""O Christmas Tree""
""How you shine so bright for me""
Children 'round the world
Shouting ""Santa's on his way""
Hoping to hear those sleigh bells ringing on his sleigh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna wrap my arms around you tight
On this cold December night

[Chorus]
It's almost here
So spread some cheer
Let's give love and get some back
The more you give the more you'll have
The fire's bright now
Snow's coming down
Grab your friends; hold them near
Christmas time is here

[Bridge]
I hear his sleigh and I know the big guy's on his way
Man I'm hoping he comes through
I hope he brings me you

[Chorus]
Well It's almost here
So spread some cheer
Let's give love and get some back
The more you give the more you'll have
Well the fire's bright now
And snow comes down
Grab your family; hold them near
Christmas time is here

[Chorus]
Well It's almost here
So spread some cheer (come on baby)
Let's give love and get some back (come on baby)
The more you give the more you'll have (whoo-hoo!)
Well the fire's bright now (you gotta you gotta)
And snow comes down (you gotta you gotta you gotta)
Grab your family; hold them near
Christmas time is here (the more you give the more you'll have)

[Outro]
Fire's burning bright
Hold me tight baby
Just give it up baby
Come on baby

[1.vers Rasmus Bjerg]
Der er sgu altid så mange problemer
Så snart vi snakker Jul og hvad vi vil
Det handler om forskellighed
Pigerne stresser rundt med gavesystemer de poster julemad på Instagram
Vi er mere til billiard og lidt Spotify med Wham
Det har så givet mig en ide vi holder julen hver for sig
Og så tager boisne sgu på drengetur med mig

[Omkvæd Rasmus Bjerg Citybois]
Vi ved præcis hvad det er der skal til
Vi gør nøjagtig alt det som vi vil
Vi nyder en six-pack imens vi hører Last Christmas (uh ja)
Ingen spil eller ku' kun det vi kan lide
Ingen snik snak spræden en skod energi
Det er så vigtigt at vi får en rigtig drenge jul

[2.vers Rasmus Bjerg]
Vi pjatter lidt og ser lidt Disney Sjov (kolon)
Og drikker shots med gløgg uden at spørge om lov
Vi slås med puder og hygger i kanen
Vi ser et blad med store nissemænd
Vi får ild i pejsen og hygger vi lidt igen
Der er så meget vi skal nå og vi kan vædde en million
På at det her bliver en juletradition

[Omkvæd Rasmus Bjerg Citybois]
Vi gør præcis lige det som vi vil
Vi spiser and uden tilbehør til
Vi går om træet imens vi synger Last Christmas (uh ja)
Vi deler gaver ud og hvem ved så kommer julemanden måske
Det er så vildt at vi nu har sådan en rigtig drengejul

[3.vers Thor]
Uh det er så Scarlet alt det her
Fri fra damejagt og julehysteri
Det er så mega pat og det er den sygeste ide
Det er som om vi før var blinde men vores drengejul får os til at se (uh ja)

[Omkvæd Rasmus Bjerg Citybois]
Vi ved præcis hvad det er der skal til
Vi klæder os ud og leger krybespil
Vi smutter mandler imens vi hører Last Christmas (uh ja)
Vi brænder nødder på et komfur og dypper kuglerne i lækker glasur
Det er så vigtig at det bliver en rigtig drengejul
Vi ved præcis hvad det er der skal til
Vi dyrker sekser i terningespil
Vi gnider øjne imens vi hører Last Christmas (uh ja)
Vi putter tæt det er drenge magi
Det er surt julen snart er forbi
Men næste år skal vi også have en rigtig drengejuuul (ja ja drengejul uh)

Her hos dig her hos dig
Tænker jeg så klart åh så klart åh så klart
Jeg' lidt for trist og lidt forladt
På en kold og mørk decembernat
Stjerner kigger ind mon de ser mon de ser
Tåren på min kind? Mon de ved hva’ det er der sker?
Hvem er fjende hvem er ven?
Og hvem ka' vise vejen hjem igen?
Ja hjem igen

Men her hos dig er altid plads til mig
Jeg stoler blindt på dig
For jeg' en bonde i et kongespil
Hvor hjerterne er frosset til og jeg
Jeg stoler blindt på dig

Verden er så stor og hvem er jeg? Jeg’ bare mig
Jeg ved jo ikke spor men jeg vil og jeg tror jeg ka'
Finde gnisten indeni
Sætte alle julehjerter fri

En stjerne på himlen
Og flere og flere
I nat føder himlen
Med jordiske veer
I nat lover himlen
At den vil befri os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias

Maria skal føde
Sin glæde med smerte
Der banker et hjerte
Bag vinterens hjerte
Selv kulden og mørket
Har håb de vil gi os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias

Hun bærer på barnet
Nu føler hun veen
Et hjerte så trodsigt
Som spurvens i sneen
En krybbe til vugge
For den som skal fri os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias. (Lille Messias)

Og han som bær verden
Bar hun som var kvinde
Som æslet bar hende
Da tiden var inde
Fred lyder det råb
Som nu genlyder i os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias

I nat ruger himlen
På glæden og freden
Så varsomt i mørket
Som fuglen i reden
Og freden og glæden
Nu fødes de i os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias

I fødslen er glæden
Forbundet med smerten
Dog aldrig var glæden
Så hjemløs i verden
Men stalden og krybben
Er tegn som skal si' os
Maria fandt plads
Da hun fødte Messias

En plads mellem får
I en stald mellem stude
Hun fødte og svøbte
Den lille i klude
Og hyrdernes glæde
Var stor som Marias
Lys tændes i mørket
Nu fødtes Messias
Nu fødtes Messias
Nu fødtes Messias

En mørk og kold december aften
Vinden pev og sneen føg
Vi sad og hørte radio
En melodi en simpel sang
Historien om den der gang
To mus faldt ned i en spand med mælk
De skreg men der kom ingen hjælp
Og snart så var det jul

To trætte mus i en spand med mælk
De svømmede rundt så godt de ku'
Men håbet svandt - hva gør vi nu?
Den ene ville drukne sig
Men makkeren sagde nej nej nej
For håbet sejrer kun måske
Så længe vi leder efter det
Bliv ved at lede efter det

Så svømmede de som aldrig før
Og mælken blev til sidst til smør
Så kravlede de op på land
Stod frem og knugede hinanden
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul

[Verse 1]
It ain't even cold outside not where I'm from
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun
My jacket don't get no love
No hats and no gloves
Not even a chance to rain
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things

[Chorus]
Hey yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things hey

[Verse 2]
Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown
(No no no downtown)
Even though it's 100 degrees gotta get out
Ain't no ice or no chills
No snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things

[Chorus]
Hey yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things hey

[Bridge]
Just imagine that we're laughing
In the cabin chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize

[Chorus]
Hey yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[?] and [?] blessing my radio
Outside it's freezing so we bring the trees in and light up
No [?] no reason the holiday season can’t make you smile

I wish I could (I wish I could)

I'm not over you

[Verse 2]
Spending my savings and Christmas-behaving like crazy
Sometimes I'm like ""What if we spent all that money on charity?""
Reindeers parading sleigh bells and snow angels
Jake Frost is fading when though else ice skating
Warm fireplaces and it's all amazing
Still I can't lie

I wish I could (I wish I could)
But I miss my baby (I miss my baby)

Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep

Then I saw mommy tickle tickle (tickle tickle Santa Claus)
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
And I'm gonna tell my dad

Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

We waited all through the year
For the day to appear
When we could be together in harmony

You know the time will come
Peace on earth for everyone
And we can live forever in a world where we are free
Let it shine for you and me

There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday

To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

We're all as one tonight
Makes no difference if you're black or white
'cause we can sing together in harmony

I know it's not too late
The world would be a better place
If we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
Send a message loud and clear

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air - you know it's everywhere
There's something about Christmas time

Får vi altid hjertets svar?

[Omkvæd]
Flyver gennem tid og sted
Passer på – jeg falder ned
Ender på et fremmed sted
Alt jeg vil er kun at finde ro og skabe fred
Gennem tid og sted
Minderne de ta’r mig med
Prøver på at finde fred
I tidsrejsen

[Verse 1]
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
It's the time that every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer?
Does a ton-up on his sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Verse 2]
Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell you
That old songs are the best?
Then she's up and rock-'n'-rolling with the rest

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Sigue]
What will your daddy do when he sees your momma kissing Santa Claus?

[Verse 2]
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head then you've been slayed

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
(It's only just begun)

So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
(Everybody's having fun)
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

The child is a king the carolers sing
The old has passed there's a new beginning
Dreams of Santa dreams of snow
Fingers numb faces aglow

Christmas time mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see

A time for living a time for believing
A time for trusting not deceiving
Love and laughter and joy ever after
Ours for the taking just follow the master

Christmas time mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see

A time for giving a time for getting
A time for forgiving and for forgetting
Christmas is love Christmas is peace
A time for hating and fighting to cease

Christmas time mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see

Christmas time mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see

Christmas time mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see

[Vers 1]
Nu står du der helt alene
Lidt genert under misteltenen
Du ser på mig som i gamle dage
Det ta'r mig tilbage det ta'r mig tilbage

[Bro]
Vi sagde stop i september
Fortrød det oktober savned' november
Jeg ka' ikke glem' dig
Ka' vi ikk' tænd' et nyt lys i december?

[Omkvæd]
Tag mig tilbage nu
Det' kun dig jeg vil ha' til jul
Og du ka' få hva' du vil - ingen årsag
Du ka' gøre næste jul til vores årsdag
Men tag mig tilbage nu

[Vers 2]
Julelys i over hele byen
Og uden dig - det' et ensomt syn men
Mennesker samles når sneen falder
Jeg håber du kalder jeg håber du kalder

Vi sagde stop i september
Fortrød det oktober savned' november

Ingen gave ku' gøre mig glad
Det' kun dig der gi'r mig fred
Jeg ku' gi' dig hva' du vil
For at få en chance til
For ingen gave ku' gøre mig glad
Det' kun dig der gi'r mig fred
Så tag mig tilbage

You might as well
You might as well wrap yourself
May beneath our tree
Cause you’ve always been the perfect gift for me

No don’t go it’s cold
There's snow on the road
So why don’t you come sit by the fire?
I’ll pour a drink
Then we can share this memory of

You right here with me
It’s something kind of wonderful
On Christmas eve
It’s crazy to think of all the little miracles
That brought you here to me

You might as well
You might as well dress yourself
Mistletoe for me
So I can steal a kiss whenever I please

Oh oh what a night
The stars and the lights
Family and friends around the fire
A toast and a drink
Then we can sing this melody of

You right here with me
It’s something kind of wonderful
On Christmas eve
It’s crazy to think of all the little miracles
That brought you here

When I close my eyes
I wish that the love I've inside never fades
It always feels this way
There's not a time or place I’d rather be
Than here tonight

Something kind of
Something kind of

You right here with me
It’s something kind of wonderful
On Christmas eve
It’s crazy to think of all the little miracles
That brought you here to me

You right here with meIt’s something kind of wonderful
On Christmas eve
It’s crazy to think of all the little miracles
That brought you here to me

It’s crazy to think of all the miracles
That brought you here to me yeah

[Verse 1]
Tell me where did we go wrong?
We should be singing Christmas songs
Instead of shouting all night long like we do
We keep fighting in the street
When we should be home wrapped in the sheets
Putting presents underneath the tree for me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we had our fair share
Of breaking up and making up
I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up no

[Chorus]
If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll be together
Baby all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

[Verse 2]
It hasn't been the greatest year
But through thick and thin we made it here
Just keep holding onto me and I'll hold you
But we made it through the hardest part
And I followed you the brightest star
I just wanna be where you are right where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we've had our fair share
Of breaking up yeah and making up
But I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up no don't

If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll have together
Baby all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

If we can make it through December (A-a-all I want yeah)
