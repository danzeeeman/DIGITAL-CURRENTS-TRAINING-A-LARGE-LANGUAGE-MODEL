    "# Phi-2\n",
    "\n",
    "Phi-2 is a Transformer with 2.7 billion parameters. It was trained using the same data sources as Phi-1.5, augmented with a new data source that consists of various NLP synthetic texts and filtered websites (for safety and educational value). When assessed against benchmarks testing common sense, language understanding, and logical reasoning, Phi-2 showcased a nearly state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 13 billion parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model hasn't been fine-tuned through reinforcement learning from human feedback. The intention behind crafting this open-source model is to provide the research community with a non-restricted small model to explore vital safety challenges, such as reducing toxicity, understanding societal biases, enhancing controllability, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## QA Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can provide the prompt as a standalone question as follows, where the model generates the text after \".\" . \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Write a detailed analogy between mathematics and a lighthouse.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "You can provide the prompt in the Instruct/Output format as follows, where the model generates the text after \"Output:\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Instruct: Write a detailed analogy between mathematics and a lighthouse.\n",
    "Output: Mathematics is like a lighthouse. Just as a lighthouse guides ships safely to shore, mathematics provides a guiding light in the world of numbers and logic. It helps us navigate through complex problems and find solutions. Just as a lighthouse emits a steady beam of light, mathematics provides a consistent framework for reasoning and problem-solving. It illuminates the path to understanding and helps us make sense of the world around us.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can provide them in a Chat style format, where each speaker is denoted by ```{Name}:```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alice: I don't know why, I'm struggling to maintain focus while studying. Any suggestions?\n",
    "Bob: Well, have you tried creating a study schedule and sticking to it?\n",
    "Alice: Yes, I have, but it doesn't seem to help much.\n",
    "Bob: Hmm, maybe you should try studying in a quiet environment, like the library.\n",
    "Alice: ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of Phi-2\n",
    "- Generate Inaccurate Code and Facts: The model may produce incorrect code snippets and statements. Users should treat these outputs as suggestions or starting points, not as definitive or accurate solutions.\n",
    "- Limited Scope for code: Majority of Phi-2 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\n",
    "- Unreliable Responses to Instruction: The model has not undergone instruction fine-tuning. As a result, it may struggle or fail to adhere to intricate or nuanced instructions provided by users.\n",
    "- Language Limitations: The model is primarily designed to understand standard English. Informal English, slang, or any other languages might pose challenges to its comprehension, leading to potential misinterpretations or errors in response.\n",
    "- Potential Societal Biases: Phi-2 is not entirely free from societal biases despite efforts in assuring training data safety. There's a possibility it may generate content that mirrors these societal biases, particularly if prompted or instructed to do so. We urge users to be aware of this and to exercise caution and critical thinking when interpreting model outputs.\n",
    "- Toxicity: Despite being trained with carefully selected data, the model can still produce harmful content if explicitly prompted or instructed to do so. We chose to release the model to help the open-source community develop the most effective ways to reduce the toxicity of a model directly after pretraining.\n",
    "- Verbosity: Phi-2 being a base model often produces irrelevant or extra text and responses following its first answer to user prompts within a single turn. This is due to its training dataset being primarily textbooks, which results in textbook-like responses."

I didn't see this squirrel anymore. I walk around, then notice that for the entire time a dog has been observing squirrels #1 and #2 from the distance, sitting, not moving. Like a statue for the entire time. After 20 minutes or so, I hear the dog's owners calling him but the dog won't move. His name is Harper. I walk around, don't notice more squirrels but then decide to come closer to squirrels #1 and #2. It's no longer two but three squirrels I see so I register Squirrel #4, then start watching the trees. I see Squirrel #5, who joins the rest of the \\\"family.\\\" Squirrels #1, #2, #4, and #5 keep climbing up and down the tree next to the baseball fields for the rest of my time there. Around five to seven humans stop by and take photos of the gang. The squirrels are indifferent through all of this. Before my time ends, I walk around once more but notice no new squirrels.

The squirrels in Stuy Townn are bold and fearless -- they want a nut and they want it now. They've become accustomed to being fed nuts by Stuy Town residents, primarily the elderly residents. Drop a nut, especially a premium one, such as a full walnut in its shell, and they will arrive en mass.
