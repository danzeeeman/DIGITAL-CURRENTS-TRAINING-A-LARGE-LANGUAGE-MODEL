    "Finding a good data source for training data is very hard.  You need massive amounts of data. One of the approaches is to use derived text to train a specific model.  You can turn statistical data into sturctured data by encoding the data with a complex transformation.  Below I take twenty years of baseball data and encode it into a structured data.  This way we use llm to generate structured data a program can understand. \n",

Jumping over each other. Very calm. No humans around. I would even say they were playing with each other. Then, immediately I see Squirrel #3 passing by and climbing a tree. I didn't see this squirrel anymore. I walk around, then notice that for the entire time a dog has been observing squirrels #1 and #2 from the distance, sitting, not moving. Like a statue for the entire time. After 20 minutes or so, I hear the dog's owners calling him but the dog won't move. His name is Harper. I walk around, don't notice more squirrels but then decide to come closer to squirrels #1 and #2. It's no longer two but three squirrels I see so I register Squirrel #4, then start watching the trees. I see Squirrel #5, who joins the rest of the \\\"family.\\\" Squirrels #1, #2, #4, and #5 keep climbing up and down the tree next to the baseball fields for the rest of my time there. Around five to seven humans stop by and take photos of the gang. The squirrels are indifferent through all of this. Before my time ends, I walk around once more but notice no new squirrels. I took a photo of Harper the dog watching squirrels. I'll send it to you.\",\n",

It wanted food. The woman annoyedly shooed it away. \\nMy hectare was mostly inaccessible, being comprised of a lot of the zoo which was \\\"authorized access only\\\" or not yet open. I was able to observe four squirrels in the densely wooded perimeter, having initially despaired of seeing any. 3 grays, 1 black. I also saw two squirrels just outside my area, in 4-I, I believe. The squirrels --> \\n--> I observed were focused on their tasks, primarily foraging. \\nI live in Stuyvesant Town, an area of Manhattan with an incredibly dense squirrel population. The squirrels in Stuy Townn are bold and fearless -- they want a nut and they want it now. They've become accustomed to being fed nuts by Stuy Town residents, primarily the elderly residents. Drop a nut, especially a premium one, such as a full walnut in its shell, and they will arrive en mass. The squirrels I saw today in Central Park, while they did not approach me, would not have needed much coaxing. You can \\\"turn\\\" a squirrel pretty quickly in this town. \\nBut enough about me...today was a fine day for a squirrel census and I very much appreciated this opportunity -- it was a very peaceful experience. Counting squirrels makes your troubles disappear into nature. \\nThanks! [drawing of squirrel]\",\n",
