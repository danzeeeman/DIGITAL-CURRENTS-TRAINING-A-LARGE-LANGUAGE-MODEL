## Ethics of Data Collection :: What is really is Fair Use?

- What is ethical data collection?  
- What is Fair Use?

From Wikipedia 

Fair use is a doctrine in United States law that permits limited use of copyrighted material without having to first acquire permission from the copyright holder. Fair use is one of the limitations to copyright intended to balance the interests of copyright holders with the public interest in the wider distribution and use of creative works by allowing as a defense to copyright infringement claims certain limited uses that might otherwise be considered infringement. The US "fair use doctrine" is generally broader than the "fair dealing" rights known in most countries that inherited English Common Law. The fair use right is a general exception, that applies to all different kinds of uses with all types of works. In the U.S., fair use right/exception is based on a flexible proportionality test, that examines the purpose of the use, the amount used, and the impact on the market of the original work.

The doctrine of "fair use" originated in common law during the 18th and 19th centuries as a way of preventing copyright law from being too rigidly applied and "stifling the very creativity which copyright law is designed to foster." Though originally a common law doctrine, it was enshrined in statutory law when the U.S. Congress passed the Copyright Act of 1976. The U.S. Supreme Court has issued several major decisions clarifying and reaffirming the fair use doctrine since the 1980s, the most recent being in the 2021 decision Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.


### Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc

From Wikipedia 

Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc., 593 U.S. ___ (2021), was a U.S. Supreme Court decision related to the nature of computer code and copyright law. The dispute centered on the use of parts of the Java programming language's application programming interfaces (APIs) and about 11,000 lines of source code, which are owned by Oracle (through subsidiary, Oracle America, Inc., originating from Sun Microsystems), within early versions of the Android operating system by Google. Google has since transitioned Android to a copyright-unburdened engine without the source code, and has admitted to using the APIs but claimed this was within fair use.

Oracle initiated the suit arguing that the APIs were copyrightable, seeking US$8.8 billion in damages from Google's sales and licensing of the earlier infringing versions of Android. While two District Court-level jury trials found in favor of Google, the Federal Circuit court reversed both decisions, holding that APIs are copyrightable and Google's use does not fall under fair use. Google successfully petitioned to the Supreme Court to hear the case in the 2019 term, focusing on the copyrightability of APIs and subsequent fair use; the case was delayed to the 2020 term due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2021, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6–2 decision that Google's use of the Java APIs fell within the four factors of fair use, bypassing the question on the copyrightability of the APIs. The decision reversed the Federal Circuit ruling and remanded the case for further review.

The case has been of significant interest within the tech and software industries, as numerous computer programs and software libraries, particularly in open source, are developed by recreating the functionality of APIs from commercial or competing products to aid developers in interoperability between different systems or platforms.

```
The Court took a newly expansive view of transformativeness in the fair use analysis, recognizing the significance of Google’s “reimplementation” of the Java API in a new context and the value of the third-party creativity the Android platform enabled.8 Although this development may feed concerns that fair use impinges on the transformation central to the derivative works right held exclusively by copyright owners,9 the Court’s expansion of transformativeness in fair use accords with the constitutional goals of the Copyright Act.

### New York Times v. OpenAI

[NYT](https://www.nytco.com/press/lawsuit-documents-dec-2023/#:~:text=On%20Dec.%2027%2C%202023%2C%20The%20New%20York%20Times,and%20wrongly%20attribute%20false%20information%20to%20the%20Times.)
[Complaint](https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf)

```
Defendants’ unlawful use of The Times’s work to create artificial intelligence 
products that compete with it threatens The Times’s ability to provide that service. Defendants’ 
generative artificial intelligence (“GenAI”) tools rely on large-language models (“LLMs”) that 
were built by copying and using millions of The Times’s copyrighted news articles, in-depth 
investigations, opinion pieces, reviews, how-to guides, and more. While Defendants engaged in 
widescale copying from many sources, they gave Times content particular emphasis when building 
their LLMs—revealing a preference that recognizes the value of those works. Through Microsoft’s 
Bing Chat (recently rebranded as “Copilot”) and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Defendants seek to free-ride 
on The Times’s massive investment in its journalism by using it to build substitutive products 
without permission or payment

Defendants have refused to recognize this protection. Powered by LLMs containing
copies of Times content, Defendants’ GenAI tools can generate output that recites Times content 
verbatim, closely summarizes it, and mimics its expressive style, as demonstrated by scores of 
examples. See Exhibit J. These tools also wrongly attribute false information to The Times.

### Discussion Time

What do you think?
What is and isn't Fair Use?
What is and isn't 'sufficiently` changed or altered?

How are images produced from an initial noise source being multiplied by transformation matrix of weights derived from many many many source images being noised and de-noised using those estimated weights not 'sufficiently' altering the image? 
What about Collages? Lamination? Remixes?

## Data Collection and Scraping Techniques

### Facts
#### Every website is different

General structures repeat themselves, yet each website is unique and will need personal treatment if you want to extract the relevant information

#### The internet is in a constant state of change, It is inevitable that scraping processes will break given enough time

Websites constantly changes! Your scraper will no doubt stop working due to changes in the API or HTML.

## Scraping as Art

## Discussion [Scrapism A Manifesto](./readings/Scrapism-A-Manifesto_2.pdf)

Sam Lavigne (born 1981) is an artist and educator based in New York. His work deals with technology, data, surveillance, natural language processing, and automation. Lavigne describes his work as "online interventions that surface the frequently opaque political and economic conditions that shape computational technologies"
