## Who?

I'm Dan Moore [he/him], I'm an Artist, Designer, and Technologist based here in New York City. I design and build interactive activations and applications.

I currently work with Artificial Intelligence to investigate pop culture. I have most recently exhibited at the Vancouver Art Gallery during THE IMITATION GAME: VISUAL CULTURE IN THE AGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. I hold a Masters of Tangible Interaction Design from Carnegie Mellonâ€™s College of Fine Art, where I studied and worked in the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry. I was a virtual research fellow in the Free Art and Technology, F.A.T., Lab. I'm an adjunct professor at The New School.

Recently, I've been creating sneakers with machine learning and calling them *airegan

I've worked at an experimentals UX design studio inside Samsung Mobile. I led a team at Squarespace doing conceptual product design. I did a couple tour's of duty at the Google Creative Lab where I led the development of Just A Line, prototyped an early version of Verne, developed the Morse Code gBoard, and prototyped the Notable Women AR experience. I've worked with advertising agencies, experiential agencies, and architecture firms to build interactive installations such as creating a video game played with a car, an F1 driver, and a Passenger with an iPad for a campaign called Trace Your Road. I'm currently fulltime with NVIDIA working with their creative team on tools and workflows for virtual production, including realtime motion capture and robotic arm integrations.
