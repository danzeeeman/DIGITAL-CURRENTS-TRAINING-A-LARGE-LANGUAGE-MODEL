## Who?

I'm Dan Moore [he/him], I'm an Artist, Designer, and Technologist based here in New York City. I design and build interactive activations and applications.

I currently work with Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to investigate Pop Culture. I have most recently exhibited _The Vivid Unknown_ at IDFA:DocLab in Amsterdam and the _airegan*_ project at the Vancouver Art Gallery during _The Imitation Game: Visual Culture in the Age of Artificial Intelligence_.  I hold a Masters of Tangible Interaction Design from Carnegie Mellon’s College of Fine Art, where I studied and worked out of the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry under the guidance of Golan Levin.  I was a virtual research fellow in the Free Art and Technology, F.A.T., Lab. I am currently a Technical Artist in NVIDIA’s Creative Department and an adjunct professor at The New School.
