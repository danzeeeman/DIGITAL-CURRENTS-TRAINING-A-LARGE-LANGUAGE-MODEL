## Course Description
This course provides a basic introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Class Website & Email

Rather than using Canvas this semester we will be using this URL https://github.com/danzeeeman/DIGITAL-CURRENTS-TRAINING-A-LARGE-LANGUAGE-MODEL/

Please bookmark that URL and refer back to it often. All deadlines, reading materials, project tutorials, and other course materials will be posted here. You will be using Google Docs, Google Drive, and other 
platforms such as GitHub to submit your project work and reading responses. The website will include links 
to these resources and instructions on how to submit work.

Please check the [site](https://github.com/danzeeeman/DIGITAL-CURRENTS-TRAINING-A-LARGE-LANGUAGE-MODEL/) as well as your @newschool.edu email regularly for any course announcements, 
possibly including last minute updates.

## Course Structure

We will usually begin class by reviewing the previous week’s homework, showing examples of student work 
and addressing any questions that came up. Then I will offer an interactive lecture on new coding topics.
Approximately every other week we will spend 30-40 minutes of class time on conceptual material and 
reading discussion. We will take a short break halfway through class.  We are going to write a lot of code together.  

## Final Grade Calculation

- Weekly homework assignments 30%
- Readings and reading discussions 15%
- Midterm project 20%
- Final project 20%
- Participation 15%

Your participation grade is based on class discussions, 
contributions to student work sharing, and questions via office hours and email.

If you challenge yourself and turn in the homeworks you will get an A.   

## Course Requirements & Assignments

### Weekly homework exercises

You will have homework assignments comprised of coding exercises. They will be due the evening 
before class on Thursdays's at 8pm, and you will submit them to your folder in our shared Google Drive. 
Homeworks will be graded as pass/fail, on a scale of 0 or 1, based on effort. You will not be evaluated 
weekly on whether your code runs perfectly or has bugs, but rather on whether you engaged the topic and 
made progress. Occasionally I may give a fraction of a point (e.g. .85) to indicate that the level of 
completeness is not quite enough. Late submissions will be marked down, but submitting something is 
always better than submitting nothing, even if late. I will try my best to keep on posting homework grades 
throughout the semester, but if I fall behind, at the time of the midterm and final I will get caught up so you know where you stand. If at any time you would like more feedback - about one piece of work specifically or about your standing in the class overall - please do not hesitate to ask.

### Weekly readings and reading responses

We also have [readings](readings/). These are indicated in the course schedule below and will 
be posted to the class github. You will be asked to submit a short reading response of about 250 words 
that mainly consists of quotes from the text that you wish to highlight and some questions or comments 
based on those passages. These will be submitted in a shared Google Doc that you will create right now and send to me. 

I will also pose questions in the Google Doc to serve as a prompt to guide your reading and responses. Like the weekly programming exercises, these will also be due at 8pm the evening before class and will also be graded pass/fail.

### Projects

There will be one project to completed: a 20 page book make with Machine Learning.

Projects will be graded based on how well they fulfill the formal requirements stated in the project 
assignment, and the degree to which they engage with theoretical concepts from readings and discussion. 
In other words, while the reading discussions are a way to process, digest, and comprehend the readings, 
the projects are a way to demonstrate an understanding of those readings, and will be graded as such. We 
won’t have any essays or written assignments in this class, in place of this, I would like your project work and write-ups to be a product of your engagement with course concepts both technical and theoretical.

## Learning Outcomes

After successful completion of this course, students will:
1. have gained a deep understanding of the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning, which may serve as a solid foundation from which to continue learning
2. have gained deep insight into precisely how LLMs operate
3. understand Machine Learning elements such as tokenizers, transformers, and classifiers

## Course readings & materials

Lecture notes: I will post weekly lecture notes that give you a recap of all that we talk about in class that week, usually including code examples. These are meant to be very helpful when working on the 
homework for that week, as homework exercises will directly build on topics discussed in the lesson.

All readings will be provided via the course website. There are no required textbooks to purchase for this 
course.

Links to other tools, platforms, references, and other online documentation will be posted to the class 
website.

You will need access to a laptop for the duration of the course to complete the projects. If this creates any 
hardship for you please let me know and I can connect you with resources on campus.

## General Mask Statement

The New School has implemented policies and guidance intended to support the health and safety of the 
university community. Mask wearing protects others, not just the wearer. All students, faculty and staff are asked to respect our entire community by abiding by university policies at any given time. New School 
community members who observe others not abiding by these expectations may gently remind them to 
respect our community health.

## Attendance and Meaningful Participation for our Course

Attendance and participation are required. Failing to show up and take part may result in a lowered grade, 
and excessive lack of engagement may result in being dropped from the course. Of course, we find 
ourselves in strange and challenging times! Safety protocols this semester dictate that we all must get 
tested frequently and positive test results of ourselves or our personal contacts may result in quarantine or isolation. 

If students or I are unable to attend class, we may need to use Zoom either to record classes for others to watch later (asynchronously), or to conduct class discussions or lessons together (synchronously). It may happen that some us may be live in person, while others are connecting over the internet. Please be flexible, compassionate, generous, and kind as we navigate these difficult arrangements. 

Please keep in mind that you are responsible for any assignment deadlines even in the event of an absence. Please check with your peers, the class website, and me regarding anything you miss due to absence.

I warmly recognize that not everyone feels as comfortable vocally participating in class situations – and 
masks will likely make speaking even more difficult than usual. I implore you to keep in mind that your 
position and perspectives are unique and valuable, and that the class and I will always benefit from your 
voice and contributions. In short: I always want to hear what you have to say, and your classmates will 
benefit from it as well. Please speak up – and try your best to make yourself heard through your mask!

## Resources 

The university provides many resources to help students achieve academic and artistic excellence. These 
resources include:
* University Libraries: http://library.newschool.edu
* University Learning Center: http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center
* University Disabilities Service: www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/
* I am more than happy to ensure any required accommodations for any students with accessibility 
issues are met. Any student who has needs or concerns about academic accommodations is 
welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students 
requesting any accommodations will also need to contact Student Disability Service (SDS). SDS 
will conduct an intake and, if appropriate, the Director will provide an academic accommodation 
notification letter for you to bring to me. At that point, I will review the letter with you and discuss 
these accommodations in relation to this course. While I am sympathetic to everyone’s different 
abilities, I cannot make exceptional accommodations without you first contacting SDS.
* Student Ombuds: https://www.newschool.edu/student-advocacy/conflict-resolution/
The Student Ombuds office provides students assistance in resolving conflicts, disputes or 
complaints on an informal basis. This office is independent, neutral, and confidential.
* Office of Financial Aid: https://www.newschool.edu/financial-aid/
During this online semester, financial aid staff remain available by email, phone, and Google 
Hangout Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. You can also make a virtual 
appointment with staff via Starfish.
Eligible students may be considered for different types of financial aid such as scholarships, 
federal grants, federal work study and federal student loans. To be considered for federal student 
aid, you will need to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) available 
online at fafsa.gov. The FAFSA is available starting October 1. The New School’s priority 
deadline to submit the FAFSA is February 15. The FAFSA needs to be submitted annually.
University and College Policies
Academic honesty, plagiarism … and computer programming and open source software
Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one 
or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary 
probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university. 
Students are responsible for understanding the University’s policy on academic honesty and integrity and 
must make use of proper citations of sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their 
work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures 
specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. 
The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures, is found at http://www.newschool.edu/policies/
Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found on the Learning Center’s website: 
http://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/avoiding-plagiarism.pdf
All of that said, software development work and coding almost always involve the appropriation and 
collaging of other people’s code. Learning computer programming often entails modifying working 
examples rather than starting from scratch. In this class we are participating in communities of shared 
practices. However, any work you borrow and/or modify must be labeled as such. If you find sample code 
and integrate it into your work, this must be clearly and obviously indicated as such. Use comments for this 
purpose (i.e. # like this or “”” or like this “””). When attributing code from others in work that 
you're submitting, clearly indicate the name of the author or a source URL, and make clear which lines of 
code are not yours.
You will not be graded down for integrating other people’s work into your own. In fact, integrating the code 
of others is often more challenging than writing your own. However, I wish to review and comment on the 
work that you do, so this must be clearly indicated. Failure to do so will be considered the same as any 
other breach of academic integrity.

## Student Course Ratings
During the last two weeks of the semester, students are asked to provide feedback for each of their 
courses through an online survey. They cannot view grades until providing feedback or officially declining 
to do so. Course evaluations are a vital space where students can speak about the learning experience. It 
is an important process which provides valuable data about the successful delivery and support of a 
course or topic to both the faculty and administrators. Instructors rely on course rating surveys for 
feedback on the course and teaching methods, so they can understand what aspects of the class are 
most successful in teaching students, and what aspects might be improved or changed in future. Without 
this information, it can be difficult for an instructor to reflect upon and improve teaching methods and 
course design. In addition, program/department chairs and other administrators review course surveys.
